No more are the days of chaos and appointing mortal beings with no superpowers. This week, President Trump used his imagination to break boundaries from the Oval office, appointing Mesoamerican God of Rain, Quetzalcoatl (pronounced quet-sal-coa-tal), as Head of the Department of the Interior. Coatl had been on hiatus since 1519, when he was responsible for scaring the Aztecs into believing the Spaniards were white colored Gods (this part is not satire, that’s actually real). Trump touted Quetzalcoatl for such a successful propaganda campaign and white supremacist fundamentalism.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now before I continue, I know you readers have no idea what the Department of the Interior does. No yea, you claim to love political satire but don’t know how the government works. Sigh. Lemme dumb it down for you. No, it doesn’t build IKEA furniture or put up decorations. It basically just manages our land, resources, and maintains trusts with Native Americans tribes. Unfortunately, Pew Research Center has rated this department as the “most boring department.” A perfect place to finally spice things up.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">As Head of the Department, Queztalcoatl promises that all of our sacrifices will not be in vain. His first plan was to take detained undocumented immigrants, and make the fight to the death against American citizens. The winner of the fight to the death would be deemed worthy of sacrifice to the Gods (again, this is real, I did my research). This would bring at least 7 months of rain, providing full harvests of maize. Wow! Sacrifices would have to take place somewhere important enough for the Gods. Quetzalcoatl proposed putting a guillotine on the Lincoln Memorial.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">The opposition response has been mixed. Former Speaker of the House and resident girlboss Nancy Pelosi stated that she is worried about sacrifices overall. “While I think it's good Trump hired an immigrant who is also indigenous, how will human sacrifice help my investment portfolio?” This appointment also comes with Quetzalcoatl’s initial statement: “Niuil noyuki ka anilitika okse teomeh nik in office” which translates to “Biden will be sacrificed first.”</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">His last announcement as a new appointee was to announce his deputies of the department, which every department is allowed to do. After being chosen so decisively, political experts predicted that the choice would calm politics, mainly a evangelical christian states man (white most likely), which would quell worries of a foreign, once believed dead, Meso-american god. However, in a shocking move, he appointed Lord Yama, the Hindu god of hell. Yama’s previous experience includes running the Gates of Hell Inc. for about 4,500 years. Despite his short experience as an executive, his record is fairly impressive in keeping hell working for so long.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:36pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What will this mean for the interior of America? Well, the expert opinion is still unsure. But what we can expect from the Trump Administration is more appointments that are out of this world. Trump seems to have moved on from the sexual abusers, sexist, alcoholics, Oil tycoons, wrestling ceos’ concubines, and other bootlickers. In exchange, Trump's search for power has now reached mythical proportions. Stay tuned as the Pinky Toe covers this very real story.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>","contentFormat":"html","imageUrl":"","imageType":"url","imagePath":null,"featured":true,"publishedAt":"2025-03-10T16:02:00.000Z","name":["Martin Akamine"],"photo":["recNwxpWgzmS6Ts1F"],"name_photo":["Elizabeth Morearty"],"createdAt":"2025-03-23T13:57:39.168Z"}
