        "content": "Hm… Egg in hand, ice beneath foot, Olga on phone. Something’s wrong. I look around. I look up. I look down. I look at the eggs. There’s a receipt hiding in my fingers. I lean down with my mouth to snatch it, and as I do, I slip. Oops… Must be more careful. I carefully take a peek at the receipt. \n\n$10 Eggs?! \n\nIn shock, my foot slides up on the slippery ice, and I begin to fall. As I fall, I pray to the Gxd of Pity to practice their ways and protect me. As I do, the divine intervention does exactly that and protects the most important, valuable, and expensive thing: the eggs. The eggs float in the air as I crash down into the thin ice, breaking it. Shards fly up my spine and snuggle in my asscrack. A stunning moment of divinity. As I lay there staring up at my fortune floating above me, I hear the laughter echoing from my best friend, Olga Syphil, who is still on the phone for some reason. \n\nAs the stars and birds flying around my head dissipate, I manage to sit up, which unfortunately only pushes the shards further up my ass (it’s okay, I don’t mind, I was born for this) despite the fragility of the frozen water.\n\nI look back at the store from which I came. Target. I knew I shouldn’t have bought something from that sellout company. Fuck Target and their weak-ass DEI rollbacks. I should’ve gone to Trader Joe’s. They would never have allowed me to slip on this ice. \n\nBut what’s done is done. I stand up (the shards in my ass now melted, dripping down, as if I was just doing colonoscopy prep and pee shitting from my ass), grab the eggs, and thank the Gxd of Pity. \n\nBut something’s still wrong, I can sense it.\n\nI open the carton of eggs, and to my horror, I realize that the worst thing has come true. They were fertilized. Great. Now I have to not only spend money on expensive ass food for myself, but I also have to spend a fortune to raise a dozen little chicks. Fuck my stupid baka life. \n\nBut then I look around and think (something that they don’t want you to do) and my mind begins to open and awaken.\n\nCould this experience be… a metaphor?",

        "content": "<p>As we are coming off of the St. Patrick’s holiday weekend, I’d like to give an encore to our favorite slutty chain-wearing Irish man Paul Mescal. Growing up, I was a Niall Horan girl, but then I really resonated with the synopsis of <em>Normal People</em>. The iconic scene when Marianne asks if Connell has talked to other girls at uni and he’s like—I'm literally still inside you—I realized that that’s something I would do. I think the perfect way for us to meet would be by both of us getting cast in a Jenny Han production, the author of <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</em> and <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, since I can seamlessly play the role of another half-Asian girl getting fucked over by a white man.</p>\n\n<p>The following are some of my qualifications for being Paul Mescal’s next victim:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brunette</li>\n<li>Ignores red flags</li>\n<li>Will forgive you easily</li>\n<li>We are probably the same pants size</li>\n<li>>10 years of experience with white men letting me down (possibly can try to get a letter of rec from one of them)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mescal is obviously in love with Daisy Edgar-Jones. That photo of him with Phoebe Bridgers at the Met Gala contributed to my childhood trauma. I didn’t imagine that his cruelty would continue onto Gracie Abrams, but then I realized he is coming for that whole friend group.</p>\n\n<p>Gracie Abrams has been seen with bangs, so the rumors are just getting stronger. I may not have abs like hers, but I am great at falling for men who don’t want me. I can’t rock the fuck-ass bob either, but if he needs me to get bangs, I’ll do what needs to be done. Now that Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are confirmed to be dating, he can’t conquer the entire friend group. Another reason I am willing to victimize myself for Paul Mescal is because I feel the need to protect Ayo Edebiri at all costs. After I saw that photo of them together on my feed, I worried for her safety and my sanity. If he is going to keep not admitting his feelings for his one true love, I might as well have some fun and let him hurt me for the plot. Whatever happens, we will be getting a Gracie Abrams album out of it. So Paulie baby, come and get it! I’m ready for you to ruin my life.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Surprise! They are the same thing. As far as ego and unrealistic perceptions of the self go, dick-tators and reigns of terror are caused by the same fundamental “shortcoming.” Those in power lack a certain je ne sais quoi which ultimately causes catastrophic repercussions felt throughout the nation. No matter the country, there will always be a rather unsavory explanation for the gradual demise of democratic systems.</p>\n\n<p>It can be quite discouraging to find yourself as a tiny sheep so carelessly being herded around by the big bad wolf. Here are three expert tested suggestions to get through trying times and ridiculous autocracies:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cut it off</strong><br>\nMove to another country! People always say they will do it but have you actually tried to? Europe is practically begging people to move back after making all those mistakes for hundreds of years. You can actually be financially compensated for your decision in some countries, including Italy and Switzerland. Pasta and cheese with holes all day? Say no more!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plead for growth</strong><br>\nWith all the technological patents and companies your dictator owns, surely your dictator will have figured out how to turn this shortcoming into the next Terminator. Once the sad shrimp turns into a techno tank, everyone's problems will be solved and there will be no need to uproot your entire life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduce Organic/Non GMO Options</strong><br>\nIf the suggestion above does not yield favorable results and ChatGPT fails to give the correct instructions to fix the issue, pass on the idea of natural healing. With the proper levels of phosphorus and enough sunlight to induce photosynthesis, perhaps Danny Devito in the seminal role of the Lorax will speak for us after all: “unless someone like you cares an awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not.”</p>\n",

Yes, I have gotten a prayer made up just for me, and just to protect against this one bitch (business major).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;\">The debilitating number of eye rolls I must complete during this 50 minute block is JUST AS IMPORTANT as the Pope’s livelihood. A couple of times, my eyes have gotten stuck, making the situation significantly worse. Though I have no way of knowing, I could feel the yaper’s jealousy of my bouncing curls and fire outfit (I haven’t washed my hair in a week and I’m wearing a sweatshirt with jeans). In the words of the pope himself “We must pray for bitches, even if it interferes with one’s own swag.”</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;\">Other than his gastrointestinal issues (side note: is the pope jewish?), the pope is named Francis.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;\">Well not actually, that is just his pseudonym, or what I like to call his “DJ name.” His real name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio or JoMaBog for short (pronounced: HOE, [my] Bawg), which is exactly the phrase I say each morning when I see Bitch. “Hoe, my bog,” I scream with angst as I approach the embodiment of all my high school bullies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;\">“The Pope told me I was his favorite comedian.&nbsp; Such an incredible experience.

You definitely shouldn’t GAF about Gaffigan. If only the pope could hear the creative array of insults I make about The Bitch. They come to me like gay people come to this magazine and rightfully render my intellectual ability nonexistent.&nbsp; I’m sure The Pope’s comedic camaraderie would switch to favor me.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;\">I’m not sure about The Church’s opinions on manslaughter, but I heard they have some great rifles for sale.

Yeah, you poop when you die.

        "content": "<p>Trisha Paytas. A name &ndash; an icon &ndash; that has haunted the general public since the early days of YouTube. Blndsundoll4mj was burned into my iPod Touch&rsquo;s screen before my rubber panda case could collect dust.</p>\n<p>In between videos of American Girl Doll unboxings, Trisha was a pillar of light in my world. She was a beacon of hope for crazy fat bitches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I understand her controversy. I cannot fault her critics. But to act as if a Trisha Paytas Broadway debut isn&rsquo;t the most camp thing of all time is something I simply will not consider. She is modelled of the clay of the early American robber baron &ndash; her money funnelled to support a creative investment never before seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As my time as Pinky Toe contributor comes to a close, I must reflect on my greatest muse. In my nearly four years of pitching articles, Trisha is my number one name. She is the sun in my sky and the ultimate being of creation. I am made in her image.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will now take the appropriate time to honor her, in an examination of all my pitches.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Trisha Paytas&rsquo;s Reformation Means There's Hope For All Crazy Bitches&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Okay, this is definitely my weakest pitch. Yet it resonates. The queer community appears to have embraced Trisha in recent years. Is she crazy or is she just eccentric? We&rsquo;re not sure. But for now she seems to have gained public favor. Always trust in a gorgeous woman&rsquo;s ability to reinvent herself!&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> The Worst Person You Know Made a Good Point: Trisha Paytas ASMR Channel&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your introduction to Trish was a kitchen floor meltdown, Frenemies implosion, or her many appearances on various media, you are likely familiar with her string of controversies. She truly imploded the entire Big Brother UK franchise. She sits at the helm of a multitude of controversies (justly), yet she also produces some of the most calming and creative material for an ASMR channel. She is the Wizard to my Oz.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> POV: You&rsquo;re the Trisha Paytas ASMR Burger King Role Play Watching Me Go To Sleep&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is based on reality. There are few things that soothe the mind quite like a true Trisha whisper; the early days of Blndsundoll4mj were lush with fields of iphone tapping unboxings and whispered purse show and tells. I&rsquo;m very particular about the ASMR I watch. Not all of Trisha&rsquo;s content makes it to my coveted ASMR playlist, but she is truly an artisan. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s simply due to her burrowing into my mind at age nine or her ever-enamoring representation for crazy, fat bitches, but something about Trisha will always relax me.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Ranking Each Song From Trisha Paytas 2017 Album Chicken Fingers and Lipo&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is really an article which haunts me. I purchased the entire album on ITunes within seconds of upload. It was the soundtrack of my life at age thirteen. Imagine my horror to find every song scrubbed from all music streaming services. Freaky was the Abracadabra to my Mayhem. I am begging all Queers to reexamine the biblical texts, Trisha is my Jesus; persecuted unjustly!</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> A Star is Born: The World Leader Reincarnated at Trisha&rsquo;s 3rd Baby&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>My obvious answer is Trump, but I don&rsquo;t feel like we will be rid of him in nine months time. Another clear winner, the Vicar of Christ himself, Pope Francis. I would argue that a Paytas child wearing the Pope&rsquo;s getup and hat seems nearly certain at this point &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t feel quite as fun to speculate an already indubitable event.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, I would like to propose some alternative reincarnations for the Paytas-Hacmon family. For some reason, I do believe her newest child will be Mao Zedong. He has been dead for some time, but I do feel like Trisha would thrive under the rule of the CCP. If I were to prophesize the next nine months, I would point to a few separate individuals that I think would fit well in the Paytas family tree: Elon Musk, Vladimir Putin, Ron Desantis, and finally, Trixie Mattel. You may be asking yourself, what do these world leaders have in common? The answer is more obvious than you think &ndash; they are all queer butches seeking redemption in their next life. Musk, Putin, Desantis, Mattel: a butch? Yes; these current iterations of their spirit all seek the approval and love of a wider audience, one you may not be tapped into. But I am.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summation of these ancient texts, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude for Miss Trish Like Fish. She has served me dutifully in all my pursuits and taught me the importance of plastic surgery. I bide my days waiting to book a lipo appointment and with a picture of her from Eminem&rsquo;s music video for Doctor Miami&rsquo;s inspo.

        "content": "Recently, a TikTok from a Duke athlete went viral– in the video, he films a student in his class holding a dog and complains about “NARP” behavior. For those that don’t know, NARP stands for non-athletic-regular-person. I don’t know, but I’d say non-student-athletes show some athleticism when they’re dodging athletes’ electric scooters left and right, but whatever.\n\nEither way, it’s a completely useless debate that no sane (gay) person cares about. After all, he was complaining about not being able to watch “football videos” in class, but the dog-holding-girl was paying attention while he was making a Tik Tok so… those low student-athlete GPAs speak for themselves.\n\nAnother thing only straight people care about? Zyns. No self-respecting nicotine addict uses ZYNS. The only context I’ve ever seen Zyns exist in is with frat brothers and male student athletes. Any gay person addicted to nicotine is just going to hit a vape, or even better, go outside and smoke a cigarette (see my Bunion article from today about the drunk cigarette epidemic.)\n\nAnd finally, while I’m complaining about straight people behavior, what the fuck is sports betting? Genuinely who in their right mind sees their paycheck hit their account and decides, “Yeah, I’m going to go gamble this away on a random player and then flood them with hate comments when they don’t score exactly as many times as I wanted them to.” \n\nMen will get mad at their wives for not making family dinner one night to go to book club, but they’re coming home and getting on their computer for FANTASY FOOTBALL?? It allllll comes back to the student athletes. \n\nBut! If you needed something to laugh at today, I received insider information that DraftKings in Boston did give employees Monday the 10th off because of INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY. They didn’t get President’s Day off, but they got a day off in honor of women.\n\nThat’s allyship, baby!",

        "content": "The club is bumping. The ladies look good. The alcohol is flowing. There is much pain in the world, but not in this room. And yet, derrieres are unmoving and still. \n\nI look around the crowded dance floor, and while there are smiles on faces, something is missing. These people have yet to experience true joy. They have yet to recognize the magic of watching the junk in someone’s trunk move up and down. This place is packed with charity cases, a.k.a men who think they actually have a shot at going home with any of the beautiful young women in here.\n\nWhile they are only successful at scaring the hoes, I still feel bad for them a little. It’s not their fault they lack social awareness, are slightly chopped, and only 5’8. Those were the cards that God dealt them.\n\nSo I do what any good samaritan would do: I put my mid-rise flare jeans to good use and shake what my mama gave me. \n\nOf course, I can only shake so much before the men start approaching. I sense their presence before I even turn around. They are mesmerized by my ability to get low low low low low low low low. But this isn’t a free for all. How can I provide the sensual movements of my bootylicious body to the masses if a handful of freeloaders try to save it all for themselves? I’m backing that ass up for everyone.\n\nAfter six songs and four different men trying to lure me away with the promise of a free drink, I decide that I must have completed enough mutual aid for one night. Community is everything, but I still gotta put me first. My knees aren’t as strong as they used to be, and my glutes are beginning to get tired.\n\nIf you too are double cheeked up and want to know how to give back to your community, try shaking ass in the club. It’s good for the soul, and you might just have some fun along the way.\n\n",

A real BobDylanMaxxer NEVER misses an opportunity to hide behind their favorite pair of shades. With this single accessory, you can assert dominance, stay anonymous, survey the room, and look cool doing it. Get dark ones too– letting people know what your eyes look like at ALL is a sign of weakness.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">2.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Hit the pose.</strong></span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> You know the one. Hunched over, hands in your jacket pockets, freewheelin’ down Bay State Rd. Everyone does it subconsciously, but the BobDylanMaxxing mindset allows you to romanticize trudging through the slushy streets on your way to class. Suddenly, youre not fighting against gale force breezes, you’re just&nbsp;</span><i><span style=\"font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Blowin in the Wind.</span></i><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> And I think that’s beautiful.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">3.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>HarmonicaMaxx.</strong></span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> As is familiar to anyone in the BobDylanMaxxing community, one of the key tenets of the lifestyle is HarmonicaMaxxing. Purchase the full hands-free setup, learn the notes, and become the life of every party. Make sure to always stay strapped, too– you never want to be caught without your harmonica in a time of need.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">4.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Stay Mysterious.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Make up an insane backstory for yourself. Hell, make up five and keep people on their toes. Offhandedly allude to tragic lore but refuse to go into detail because it’d be too painful. Keep it cryptic– but if anyone asks, you were raised in the circus.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;position:relative;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;width:100px;\"></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">5.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Embrace being an asshole.</strong></span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> The final step to truly BobDylanMaxxing is simply becoming comfortable being a little bit of a bitch. Show up late; leave early. Show up uninvited; don’t show up at all. Flash cunty glares at every camera and kick people out of your parties just because you can. Don’t be afraid to channel your inner Bob and prioritize YOU.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">And just like that, you’re now prepared to tackle the rest of the semester with newfound confidence, grace, and style.

My roommate was doing his usual thing (not speaking and watching Minecraft streamers on his laptop), and I was doing my usual thing (yearning for a man).\nI know, right? Pathetic. But hear me out: I am a twink in heat. The worst type of twink, I’ll add. The incredulous thought of a man with a septum piercing was the only thing I could focus on right then. Maybe he listens to Paramore… the yearning whispered. Maybe he owns not one, but FOUR carabiners! And maybe he’s really hipster and goes by He/They…\nI needed to get out of my room. The yearning was becoming too strong. I grabbed the garbage bag and headed outside toward the dumpster to toss out my REDACTED (trust me, y’all don’t want to know what I threw away). But just as I was about to dispose of my unmentionables, I heard a faint meow.\nIt was a cat! A beautiful black cat with the biggest eyes one could only dream of. But what was it doing there? Why was this gorgeous little pussy just sitting around the Back Street dumpsters?\nTo steal my fucking meal swipes, that’s why.\nDon’t let that fabulous little feline fool you. Because the brief moment I spent gushing over that pretty pussy created the perfect opportunity for that cat to jump up and snatch my BUID straight from my little gay hands.\nUnfortunately, the cat—still an unidentified suspect in an ongoing case—has been targeting queer residents across Bay State Road, stealing their BUIDs to swipe into the Fenway dining hall. The cat has been able to get away with it because, quite literally, nobody eats at Fenway. The cat is their only customer.\nStiffen your wrists, alphabet people! There’s a crazy pussy out there (sorry, not that kind, lesbians), and it wants to take your precious meal swipes. I’ve reached out to President Melissa Gilliam for any comments on this travesty and have yet to receive a message back (she’s probably still hitting my vape).\nKeep your eyes open and remind yourself to stay woke. \n",

No more are the days of chaos and appointing mortal beings with no superpowers. This week, President Trump used his imagination to break boundaries from the Oval office, appointing Mesoamerican God of Rain, Quetzalcoatl (pronounced quet-sal-coa-tal), as Head of the Department of the Interior. Coatl had been on hiatus since 1519, when he was responsible for scaring the Aztecs into believing the Spaniards were white colored Gods (this part is not satire, that’s actually real). Trump touted Quetzalcoatl for such a successful propaganda campaign and white supremacist fundamentalism.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now before I continue, I know you readers have no idea what the Department of the Interior does. No yea, you claim to love political satire but don’t know how the government works. Sigh. Lemme dumb it down for you. No, it doesn’t build IKEA furniture or put up decorations. It basically just manages our land, resources, and maintains trusts with Native Americans tribes. Unfortunately, Pew Research Center has rated this department as the “most boring department.” A perfect place to finally spice things up.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">As Head of the Department, Queztalcoatl promises that all of our sacrifices will not be in vain. His first plan was to take detained undocumented immigrants, and make the fight to the death against American citizens. The winner of the fight to the death would be deemed worthy of sacrifice to the Gods (again, this is real, I did my research). This would bring at least 7 months of rain, providing full harvests of maize. Wow! Sacrifices would have to take place somewhere important enough for the Gods. Quetzalcoatl proposed putting a guillotine on the Lincoln Memorial.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">The opposition response has been mixed. Former Speaker of the House and resident girlboss Nancy Pelosi stated that she is worried about sacrifices overall. “While I think it's good Trump hired an immigrant who is also indigenous, how will human sacrifice help my investment portfolio?” This appointment also comes with Quetzalcoatl’s initial statement: “Niuil noyuki ka anilitika okse teomeh nik in office” which translates to “Biden will be sacrificed first.”</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">His last announcement as a new appointee was to announce his deputies of the department, which every department is allowed to do. After being chosen so decisively, political experts predicted that the choice would calm politics, mainly a evangelical christian states man (white most likely), which would quell worries of a foreign, once believed dead, Meso-american god. However, in a shocking move, he appointed Lord Yama, the Hindu god of hell. Yama’s previous experience includes running the Gates of Hell Inc. for about 4,500 years. Despite his short experience as an executive, his record is fairly impressive in keeping hell working for so long.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:36pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What will this mean for the interior of America? Well, the expert opinion is still unsure. But what we can expect from the Trump Administration is more appointments that are out of this world. Trump seems to have moved on from the sexual abusers, sexist, alcoholics, Oil tycoons, wrestling ceos’ concubines, and other bootlickers. In exchange, Trump's search for power has now reached mythical proportions. Stay tuned as the Pinky Toe covers this very real story.</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\"> </span></span></p>",

        "content": "Rating Each School by How Good Their Track Runners are in Bed \nRachel Stern \n\n\n“I’m a runner I’m a track star” - Mooski\n\nI have a knack for sleeping with guys on sports teams. The only time I have ever caught balls was with my mouth. I hit a home run almost every weekend if you know what I mean. I have only ever hit cardio when riding is involved. I only run when I know a hunk is waiting for me at the finish line. Needless to say, I feel like I know Boston track stars pretty well. \n\nHere are my rankings of teams that have crossed the finish line: \n\n5. Boston College: UGH. NO. Boston College is only good for 2 things, football and hockey. Now THOSE MEN know how to do it. But their track team?? Those fake Bostonians have me faking it. \n\n4. Tufts: The good-boys of the track-sex intersection. They just want to be told they are doing so great. An inordinate amount of them are still in love with their Christian high school ex-girlfriends, but this makes them incredible in bed. While not kinky, they will kiss your forehead and blush at praise. \n\n3. MIT: Boyfriend Dick. The perfect Goldilocks porridge. With the right amount of stamina and size, it always gets the job done. Are my legs shaking after? No, this is a marathon, not a sprint. But am I always satisfied? Yes, it is a beautifully average experience. \n\n2. BU: Kinky sex. Yum. \n\n1. Harvard: I hate to say it, but Harvard is my number 1. This is a race that leaves me breathless, legs shaking, sweat running, blown away. I didn’t know that daddy’s money could buy you good dick, but maybe I should have known that. Every time I go to a Harvard track event, I know I am getting it good. If only their legs could outrun their ego. \n\nThere you have it!! These are the men that have run right through my heart and straight to my pussy. I have never been so good at running, but maybe I should give the long jump a try since I seem to leap to conclusions. Have I mentioned that I accidentally fell in love with each of these men throughout my time in Boston? Anyway… more updates to come! Next up: I’m going to shoot my shot with basketball teams. ",

Either that or at gunpoint (about 50% of gun violence happens due to Glee-related questioning).",
        "content": "<p>In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, the ‘Telephone’ singer revealed the relationship she had with Glee:</p>\n\n<p>“Yes, I’m a Gleek. I love Glee. I love all the actors on Glee and I love the show.”</p>\n\n<p>An insane sentence to say when Matthew Morrison is on the show and sings the Thong Song! This shocking truth came about while the ‘Bad Romance’ singer was hooked onto a lie detector test, which would be the only way someone would get a confession of this magnitude out of someone. Either that or at gunpoint (about 50% of gun violence happens due to Glee-related questioning).</p>\n\n<p>But the ‘Always Remember Us This Way’ singer isn't the only Gleek in Hollywood. I’ve compiled a small list of celebrities who must love Glee.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Idina Menzel</strong> - The ‘Olaf’s Frozen Adventure’ actress wasn’t always the voice of Elsa. She played Rachel Berry’s biological mother who gave her up for adoption to Rachel’s gay dads (one of which is played by Jeff Goldblum). This ‘Rupaul Drag Race AllStars’ guest judge sang a powerful mother-daughter duet with Lea Michelle to ‘Poker Face,’ which is long believed to have been how the ‘Joker: Folie à Deux’ star found out about Glee in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> - The “The Brown Bear & Friends” by Bill Martin Jr. audiobook narrator couldn’t seem to get enough of Glee, appearing in a whopping 5 episodes of the show. The vagina candle maker seemed to somewhat forget about her time on Glee though, which might be a good thing. When told she made out with Matthew Morrison for the show, she exclaimed in disgust and skeed down a hill. We were unable to schedule a follow-up interview.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jennifer Coolidge</strong> - The upcoming ‘Minecraft’ movie actress – a role in which she is reportedly going to fall in love with a jobless villager – had her starring as the iconic character Britteny’s mother. She’s never actually talked about her time in the show, but we assume she must have felt a great honor being the fake mother of such a real legend like Britteny S. Pierce, who should not be confused with Britney Spears.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finneas O’Connell</strong> - Billie Eilish’s brother played a small role as a background character, a role he says came naturally to him due to always being “in her shadow.” While he did not clarify who, it should be noted O’Connell said this was drawing red Xs over his sister’s eyes. Although, it was hard to determine whether it was his sister or his girlfriend in the picture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong> - This ‘’An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success” actress sang of not only watching Glee with an unnamed boo, but of watching reruns of Glee. Only a true fan would be willing to put up with going back and watching Glee. After all, it is a medical board approved psychological disorder.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the ‘Government Hooker’ singer is but just one of many in a long list of celebrities who loves Glee. An unsurprising fact, as Glee is the best show to ever exist and– oh just shoot me so I don’t have to compliment Glee.</p>\n",

But what we DO know is that, with proper preparation, you can turn your work camp into a <em>werk</em> camp!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve put together an essential packing guide so you can go unmedicated, unregulated, and unvaccinated in comfort and style! Before you head off to your wellness farm, you’ll need:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Your gold coin to sacrifice to the Brain Worm in exchange for safe passage.</strong> If you cannot procure real gold, a chocolate coin will suffice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Extra denture glue.</strong> After all of your real teeth fall out from drinking water with no fluoride, you’re going to want to be prepared so that your false ones don’t keep falling out too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Werk gloves.</strong> We suggest a pair that says you’re here to slay, not to stay. Think lace, mesh, rhinestones. Don’t put too much consideration into their practicality; without your adderall, we know you’re not going to get any work done anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Binoculars.</strong> With no tech allowed, you’re going to need to resort to the analog way of stalking your wellness farm crush.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. A value pack of Charmin Ultra Soft.</strong> With all the raw, unpasteurized milk you’re going to be ingesting, you can expect a near-constant stream of violent diarrhea streaming from your ass from sunup to sundown like the Yellowstone geyser. A high quality toilet paper is of the utmost importance to keep your hole from resembling the fiery pits of hell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. A COPIOUS AMOUNT of condoms.</strong> You and a bunch of mental illness-ridden baddies with the saddies all together in a hotbed of daddy issues and disordered attachment styles, and you think you’re not gonna freak it? Think again. Those fields aren’t going to get plowed half as much as the people working them.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can go into your wellness camp prepared for everything from dragging a dead bear through the park to fighting off the measles. Before you head off, we’ll leave you with these parting words of wisdom: good fucking luck?</p>\n",

I talk big game for a girl who is immediately overstimulated by post-nasal drip. And as the weather in Boston plummets to what feels like sub-zero temperatures (which could mean nothing), so does my general health and wellness. So, on a recent and fateful Sunday afternoon, I purchased enough off-brand Mucinex to supply a small village in the face of one of the greatest adversaries known to mankind – the common cold.</p><p>After taking one maximum dose Mucinex pill at one in the morning, which, my roommate has now informed me, contains some shit used in meth production, I fell quickly asleep. Blissfully, even, as I drifted into dreams of clear sinuses and a portable-tissue-free tote bag. Walter White made NOT A SINGLE APPEARANCE in my subconscious.</p><p>So, keeping that in mind, imagine my surprise when I woke up and, having unexpectedly lost my (usually fire) motor skills, tumbled off of my Boston University issued mattress and onto a floor that has not been vacuumed since move-in!</p><p><strong>Something was wrong.</strong></p><p><em>Colors?</em> Brighter than usual. <em>Shapes?</em> Haunting my periphery. <em>Head?</em> Ringing. <em>Walking?</em> On a diagonal. <em>Class?</em> In twenty minutes.</p><p>After a disorienting T ride and a giggle of pure childlike delight in response to the sound the elevator makes when it hits floor 2 of CGS, I made my way to my Understanding Television lecture <strong>high off a perc</strong>.</p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder what happened. I’ve taken Mucinex a million times. Why, all of a sudden, was I signing the wrong name on my attendance sheet?</p><p>After starting a new antidepressant this winter break, I hadn’t thought to look up the effects it would have on cough medicines. Nor did I ChatGPT it, which editor-in-chief of <em>The Pinky Toe</em> Ava Carrel suggested I do when I called her crouched with my forehead pressed against the side of a stall in the CGS bathroom. (Some people have asked me, hey, why didn’t you call your doctor first? Why, as you wondered if you were experiencing ER-warranting heart palpitations, call the editor-in-chief of <em>The Pinky Toe</em>? To that I say, I refer to the most trusted sources of information in my most trying times, a level of diligent media literacy we all should strive for in today’s political climate.) Ava assured me that I wasn’t going to die, just “don’t have caffeine or something stupid like that.”</p><p>Cancelling my Brown Sugar Oat Milk Shaken Espresso on Grubhub, I took a deep breath and decided that if Addison Rae could make an appearance at Sweat Tour, I could make an appearance at a lecture I pay to attend. I went back to class, tremors in my hand but in a cool, trend-setting, feminist kind of way. <em>The Greta Gerwig of hand tremors.</em></p><p>As I sat dazed in lecture, I wondered – <em>why</em>? Why me, why now? What sinister forces, karmic or unrelated, were at play on this random Monday morning?</p><p>Then, it hit me. Only one man could be behind this: <strong>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. himself.</strong></p><p>As decreed by the alleged worm in RFK’s brain (which I’m convinced is more of a <em>Ratatouille</em> situation but can’t produce any real evidence for), we lowkey don’t fuck with antidepressants anymore.</p><p>And you know what? <strong>Yeah.</strong> Because no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, and there I was, emailing my Screenwriting 1 professor about the irony of using a software called “Final Draft” to write my screenplay’s rough draft (<em>not even clever. Not even clever.</em>)</p><p>Then I thought about it more critically. Of course this happens now. Of course – <em>that’s what they want you to think.</em> They want you to think, <em>“no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, no one told me shit about the Mucinex situation, go RFK, boo antidepressants.”</em></p><p>To this I say, <strong>no.</strong></p><p><strong>No.</strong> If this is the America we’re faced with in the year of our Lord 2025, an America where we’re expected to surrender our NDRIs over one measly Mucinex-induced fit of hysteria, then we have to face it head-on. RFK and his soon-to-be-revealed worm farm are trying to scare you into backing away from your hard-earned, well-deserved meds. You did not go through Spotify Wrapped after Spotify Wrapped with <em>“Funeral”</em> by Phoebe Bridgers in your top 5 just to stop taking your antidepressants over a cough!</p><p><strong>Resist.</strong> Stand up for your rights, one Mucinex high at a time <3</p></body>",

        "content": "<p><strong>January 6, 2025</strong>—A mere fortnight before DJ Trump’s tragic second inauguration, gays took the Capitol by storm, armed only with $7 iced lattes, what was left of their poppers stash, and a dream. Now why would they do that, you ask? Storming the Capitol is tired and overdone—we saw how it went the first time. But if hordes of gun-toting, flag-waving Republicans can cause such a ruckus, then surely the gays could do them one better. Switch out those <strong>Trump Pride flags</strong> for <strong>Twink Pride flags</strong> and ditch the guns for meticulously rehearsed runway walks (right into the chamber). <strong>This time there was a battle worth fighting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the time of DJ Trump’s election, he made—as many politicians do—an abundance of false promises. Normally, I wouldn’t be too concerned about such empty words, the wishful “thinking” of what some “people” like to call our “president.” But this time something felt different. He spoke <strong>clearly (huh?)</strong> and with <strong>eloquence (say what?)</strong>, and I started to think... <strong>could he really be serious this time?</strong> Could he really be trying to pry poppers from the hands of the plethora of <strong>Troye Sivan look-alikes</strong> who were soon to grace the Capitol’s steps? I was getting a little bit scared this time. Not for myself, mind you, but for any of my dear friends who desperately want, who desperately <strong>NEED</strong> to feel the rush.</p>\n\n<p>I sometimes wonder about what good poppers could do for the Trump administration. If someone were to give <strong>RFK Jr.</strong> a little sniff, would his <strong>brain worm issue</strong> be sorted out? If <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> had cracked open the bottle in 2016, would he have been able to keep his eyes open on the Senate floor? If <strong>JD Vance</strong> had... well, actually, we all know that’s nothing new for him.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, <strong>this is not only an attack on the LGBTQ+ community but detrimental to the foundation of our nation’s political, diplomatic, and constitutional integrity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Just give the gays what they want!!</strong> If they won’t be able to <strong>pop</strong> the question soon, then we should at least let them keep their poppers.</p>\n",

Everywhere I turn, people are still calling my dear friend by her old, outdated name. <strong>It's 2025, people! Have we learned nothing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That’s why, when my dear friend informed me that she would now like to be referred to as <strong>\"Gulf of America,\"</strong> I didn’t hesitate. I didn’t question it. I didn’t crack a joke about it sounding like a failed geopolitical strategy or a nationalist hellscape jacking itself off. I simply nodded, adjusted my vocabulary, and made a mental note to update my contacts accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Because that’s what allies do.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some people—ignorant, outdated relics—might scoff at the idea of a name like Gulf of America. They might ask, <em>“Is she a sovereign body of water? A military operation? A glitch in the AI that generates country music festival names?”</em> But to that, I say: <strong>Does it matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gulf of America is not just a woman—<strong>she is a vast and mighty force, a shimmering expanse of identity where the sun sets over freedom itself.</strong> When she walks into a room, you don’t just see her—you experience her, like a warm, oil-rich breeze rolling over colonized coastlines.</p>\n\n<p>I know accepting this new name change can be hard. It takes time. It takes effort. It takes updating email signatures, social media accounts, accepting living in an imperialism nightmare, and deciphering autocorrect. But we must remember to hold each other accountable.</p>\n\n<p>In class this week, when the professor called my queen by the wrong name, I saw my chance. I raised my hand and said, <strong>“Actually, it’s ‘Gulf of America,’ not ‘Gulf of Mexico.’”</strong> My professor was shocked and offended (<em>what happened to that strong BU neoliberalism?</em>) but I stood my ground and refused to complete any of my assignments until all professors stopped deadnaming!</p>\n\n<p>But of course, my radical allyship was met with what can only be described as institutional apathy.

A fellow student, someone I barely knew but recognized from their <em>“Woke and Proud”</em> shirt, stopped me. “Hey,” they said, “I saw what you did in class. I just wanted to say, I see you and hear you.”</p>\n\n<p>Like two ships passing through gay waters in the night, we parted ways. But I leave these Rhett-infested waters knowing that I stood up for what I believe in. And somewhere, somehow, somebody out there will always hold space for me and the <strong>“Gulf of America.”</strong></p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Raymond A. Mungo was a loud and proud student activist at this very institution in the 1960s. Many may not know that BU was considered the Berkeley of the East by people during the 60s because of the widespread and unified efforts to protest the Vietnam War, protests led by Mungo.</p>\n\n<p>But after 4 long, hard years of fighting the establishment, Mungo eventually just started a commune in Vermont. I mean, what is more anti-establishment than removing yourself from society and living by your own means.</p>\n\n<p>So that is what I did, I unshackled myself from the confines of societal norms and an ever-growing totalitarian state and started a queer non-platonic low-committal eight-person polycule, and I joined a traveling renaissance fair.</p>\n\n<p>In a ren fair I can be a knave, a scoundrel, a jester. Return back to the past, to an unrestrained form of my humanity, and simply be silly and whimsical. Why worry about modern problems, like having a dictator for a president, when I can wear a pink and green motley and hop around with joy as I humiliate myself for other’s entertainment? I mean I already do that now, why not do it at a ren fair.</p>\n\n<p>Now if it wasn’t obvious by my motley and silly aura, I am a jester. I prance, frolic, skedaddle around the fair and publicly humiliate myself. I found that my time as a film major helped me maximize my potential in this role. The truest and rawest form of my humanity can only be released through unadulterated jestering. I have seen the universe, or whatever cosmic being exists out there, reach out to me and tickle my soul, something I never felt in society. All through jestering.</p>\n\n<p>At this ren fair I have found many fair ladies and they/them to the point that I have created a queer non-platonic low-committal eight-person polycule. This radical reorganization of the family unit fundamentally undermines societal norms. My polycule consists of a mage, a candle maker, a couple knights, two non-binaries named Sock, a nobleman cheating on his wife, and Alice. This queer non-platonic low-committal eight-person polycule, perchance, is more authentic and radical than any of Marx’s work.</p>\n\n<p>I understand the dichotomy of the traditional renaissance faire and my revolutionary love life, but when egg prices are this high one must look back at the past and reinvent one's life as they know it. I am simultaneously challenging the capitalist, patriarchal society as well as simply reclaiming LARPing for the cool and indie people.</p>\n",

        "description": "Everyone, I am so sorry.",
        "content": "<p><strong>Everyone, I am so sorry.</strong></p>  \n\n<p>A couple weeks ago now, I was unable to shower after a particular trip to Fitrec. Apparently, other people are unaware that you have to wipe down the machines after you use them. Now I, like a buffoon, had assumed that everyone had the common courtesy to do such a thing, and neglected to wipe down my machine (the humble elliptical) prior to my thirty-three minute high intensity workout.</p>  \n\n<p><strong>And I Got RINGWORM.</strong></p>  \n\n<p>My two best friends are gorgeous intelligent hilarious Black women, one of which has OCD that often manifests through medical anxiety. This woman also happens to be my roommate. That being said, she was freaked at the thought of me contracting ringworm. I literally would have never had it checked out if I hadn’t shown her and been like “Is that weird? It’s been here for about a week now…” so thank god for that. Immediately, we had to go our for antibacterial laundry detergent and hella Lysol, which she uses to spray me down with after I come back from class.</p>  \n\n<p>Ringworm, as some of you may know, is <strong>not actually a worm.</strong> It is a fungal infection that’s highly contagious and it literally eats your skin. I’ve been romanticizing it by leaning against a doorframe solemnly or looking out the window contemplatively and saying things like “This fungus is eating me alive…” which helps a bit. I’m grateful ringworm doesn’t actually involve worms, because it sounds like such a dog disease where there are actual worms inside you. Nope, it’s just the fungus 😂!</p>  \n\n<p>Luckily, we’ve come to a great solution. <strong>I live in a big inflatable ball</strong> in our South Campus apartment-style dorm! It’s awesome! She opens a special hole to deliver me Goldfish and Mini M&M’s. It’s so easy to hotbox, and I have my Nintendo 3DS in there. I’m fine, trust! Having ringworm isn’t even that bad 😊The fungal spores and I are becoming really tight! They said I might be able to integrate into the mycelial hivemind soon, which I think would be super cool. If they’re eating me alive, why should I be lonely while it happens?</p>  \n\n<p>I just have so much <strong>white guilt already,</strong> I can’t believe I brought such a contagious disease into our house during Black History Month. I’ve made up for this by treating them as much as possible, including venmo transactions with captions such as “Beautiful Risings Goddess” and “Reparations 😞💔”. I think that’ll make up for the actions of the white race as a whole!</p>  \n",

My boyfriend? Soaked.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">What is this mysterious fluid? I wondered to myself. Then I realized: Holy shit– it’s my gender fluid.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I tried to mop up as much as I could to save my precious nutrients, but it was no use. I felt… dry. 😞 Suddenly I sat up and checked my phone. I had to get to the bottom of what was going on with me. That’s when I saw it. Trump signed an executive order stating there are only two genders.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I start to spiral. I’ve been nonbinary for so long I don’t even remember what my gender assigned at birth was. I quickly pull down my pants to check what is between my legs and find something so disturbing it’s hard for me to write.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I am completely smooth.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I screamed for a minute straight. This can’t be. Literally how am I supposed to jork it now????</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I fall to my knees, pounding the floor with my fists when I realize I need to harden myself. I rise to my feet with a new sense of purpose– a new mission. I have to castrate Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">He took my genitalia from me and I must do the same to him. I started out by transferring for my last semester of college to NYU and switching majors to whatever Barron Trump studies. He’s incredibly easy to spot, as I am a million feet tall so my sights are instantly set. I sit next to him in my first lecture and to my surprise he invited me home immediately – seems like a lonely guy tbh. But I’m in and that’s all that matters. I wonder if I should castrate Barron to send a message to Don that I am coming for him, similar to Rosalie from Twilight, but decide against it. Not worth the trauma of having to see his penis.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">His invite home only extended to his ginormous New York apartment, but I bided my time. Finally, President’s Day of all days arrived. Perfect. Baby Barron was going home to DC for the weekend and I got the invite to accompany him. I packed my soooootcasee and hopped on the private jet to the white house.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">When we got there to my surprise Barron wanted to introduce me to his parents almost immediately. This was going to be easier than I expected 😏. But to my surprise it was because–</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">What? This can’t be…</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I watch as Barron gets down on one knee and proposes to me in front of Donald and Melania. I pretend I am speechless when in actuality I am trying to swallow the vomit I am involuntarily regurgitating into my mouth (guess I still have some sort of fluid in me) and nod my head as if I’m Margaret Qualley in the end of The Substance. It pains me to indicate yes, but I have no choice. My mission is my mission.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">That night we go to bed except I stay up watching YouTube videos on how to castrate someone. I probably should have done this earlier but better late than never. When I finally have a good enough grasp on it I know it’s time to strike.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I tip-toe around the white house and find Trump’s room, but when I pull his pants down I’m met with… nothing. What the hell? He is also smooth.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I’m walking back to my room with my head hung in defeat when I stumble upon a trap door. Since my mission was a fail and I have nothing left to lose I go in. That’s when I see it. Oh Em Gee. It’s a giant vat of gender fluid! I can get my nonbinary swagger back!!!!</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">I craft an elaborate tubing system that would have made the Romans proud and funnel all of the fluid to the aircraft wing and start dropping gender fluid on the entirety of America.</p>\n\n<p id=\"\">In the morning everyone will wake up nonbinary. God is good. The nonbinary agenda has finally been fulfilled and I can rest easy.</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">Recently, I created a list stacked to the brim of diva gay icons for me to listen to. Paula Abdul, Madonna, Diana Ross, and of course, the icon and legend, Janet Jackson. I started with <em id=\"\">Control</em>. A fine album indeed. A great start. I then moved on to <em id=\"\">Rhythm Nation 1814</em>. Wow. Blown away. Insane. I thought for sure that I had reached peak gayness. And then I listened to <em id=\"\">janet. (Deluxe Edition)</em>. Hoooolyyy cow. Who had been hiding this gem from me? It was amazing. But let’s not get ahead of myself. Let me explain a few other things.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">My love for Trader Joe’s started at a very young age. I met my best friend Olga Syphil in the second grade (yes, she’s still my best friend even though she planted three hemorrhoids in my anal cavity and five tucked away behind my uvula). We bonded over our love for sugar and her love of cannibalism. However, perhaps the most exciting part of being her friend was the fact that her dad worked at Trader Joe’s. Each time we went to Trader Joe’s we would look to see if he was working that day, and if he was, he would give me a little lollipop. Truly the best thing you could ever receive as an elementary schooler. And thus, I began to connect Trader Joe’s with sweetness and Olga (and Olga with the fresh scent of a roasted human body, seasoned to perfection with the Trader Joe’s Mushroom &amp; Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend!).</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">My love for serving face, however, started quite recently. (If you must know, the longer I’ve been single, the more my hate and anger has increased, fueling my love for showing off my face card.)</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">This brings us to a few weeks ago, when I desperately needed groceries to kick off the beginning of what will surely be a great semester. As I perused through Trader Joe’s, I collected many sweet artifacts and treasures. I bartered with the weak punk-ass wimpy college employee that kindly bagged my gems and made great conversation with me (they definitely truly cared about me—it’s their job) and walked out of god’s gift to Earth with my giant bag of grocery on my shoulder. And then I strolled.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">As I strolled, however, I found the weight of the grocery to be difficult. It weighed me down. I could feel the demons beneath the crust and mantle using their divine influence to pull me into the core. So, I had to fight back the only way I knew how. By serving face. And serve face I did. My sharp jawline cut the <em id=\"\">Control</em> they had on me as my right brow arched so far, creating a <em id=\"\">The Velvet Rope (Deluxe Edition)</em> between my face card and the geoscience demons. However, as I looked down at my bag, I realized that the demons were also pulling down on my grocery, and as an Empath, I could feel it as well. I was losing this battle. And there was only one thing that could help.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">I looked down at my phone and pressed play to continue my first listen-through of <em id=\"\">janet. (Deluxe Edition)</em>. “DJ, make me wet.” Immediately, Janet started to moan and sensually whimper in my ear as <strong id=\"\">Throb</strong>, perhaps one of her best songs ever, blasted in my ears. “I can feel your body, pressed against my body, wrap yourself around me, love to feel you throbbin.’” I was empowered. The moaning and throbs trickled down my ears, throbbing through my entire temple (because, after all, that’s what our bodies are), striking great terror into the demons’ minds. They didn’t even stand a chance. “Boom, boom, boom, until noon, noon, noon.” All they got was three big booms and three small noons, and suddenly, I was immediately transported back to my lovely gutted Buswell South Campus apartment with my grocery. Smiling, I sighed and looked up like the manic pixie dream girl I am. I then began to unload my groceries and cook my dinner. And as I had just gotten groceries from Trader Joe’s, I was thankfully eating good that night. I sat down and put my meal all neatly arranged in front of me and dug in. And sure enough, the seven fingers and three breasts of Olga Syphil’s bastardized clone from the year 4673 was seasoned to perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n",

In the wake of this absolute tragedy I bring you the latest developments in sociology. According to the highly educated twittershpehere reverse racism has now been proven real! \n\nA black woman who has won more grammys than anyone else in the world, and been in the music industry for over thirty years, won album of the year over a white woman who's been in the music industry for barely ten. The Recording Academy has obviously not gotten Donald Trump’s memo that DEI is over.\nThe white woman of our generation, Taylor Swift, also walked away from the Grammys with not a single win. Coincidence? I think not!\n\n If we ignore the overwhelming evidence from this year’s Grammys as well as history: Sabrina, Chappell, and Lady Gaga all walk away with wins, Beyoncé is the first Black woman to win best country album, and Doechii is one of three black women to ever win best rap album (and let's face it, white people ain't making exceptionally great rap), there’s absolutely no other explanation!\nIt is time to mobilize the white population of the United States. Start victimizing yourself and compare years of systemic inequality and oppression to small interactions with the people you’ve oppressed and minority groups finally getting their flowers. \n\nWhat’s that? They were already doing that? Well then…keep it up guys, you’re already professionals! Well you’re at it, don’t be shy in enforcing that system of BIPOC privilege cause we definitely have that.\n",

        "content": "And they say girls with red hair can’t ski…\n\nJust kidding, nobody says that. But it was funny to joke that I was defying all odds as I made my merry way down the bunny hills.\n\nI’m from Phoenix, Arizona, so my ass has never graced the ski slopes before. “Lauren, it’s like a sand dune but cold,” my friend Mark joked. \n\nNow, despite what most East Coasters assume, there IS snow in Northern Arizona. I KNOW what snow is, I just don’t find myself there very often. But this time, I finally cracked my wallet open to take part in a ski trip with friends.\n\nPutting those tight-ass ski boots on and waddling through thick, powdery snow made me feel like a fish out of water. It didn’t help that there were two-foot-tall kids effortlessly whizzing past me in flashy outfits the whole time. No one likes being bested by someone that probably doesn’t even know their multiplication tables yet.\n\nIt was really fun to be there though. The mountain was full of characters! Characters #1 and #2: The newly-wed couple. The man was dressed in a full suit, and his new wife wore a long lavender silk dress with a little fur coat on top. You know, proper ski attire for over-the-top obnoxious straight people. I just KNOW their gender reveals are gonna go crazy.\n\n“Think they want a third?” my friend Jonny joked. A little later, we headed to the four person ski lift, and being a group of five, Jonny volunteered to roll solo. Suddenly, right in front of us in line was the couple! Jonny walked up to join them on the lift, when suddenly–\n\n“Could it just be us, please?” They did NOT want a third.\n\nEventually, when I was able to make my way down a slope without falling, my East Coast friends ditched me and Mark (Californian) to go take on harder slopes, such as Stillness, The Chute, and True Grit. I shuddered at the names alone.\n\nMark and I were kiki-ing as a duo on the four person ski lift when I realized I had dropped my glove at some point. Luckily, we met Character #3 as we stepped off the lift. She was a small child that pointed at me and yelled, “YOU DROPPED YOUR GLOVE!”\n\n“It’s near pole 5,” her kind-hearted father clarified. So, Mark and I set off on a journey: we were going to meander down the long ass slope in search of my glove. Once we made it to pole 5, I saw it sitting atop a pile of snow and thought, let me get right in there! Bad idea. My ski sunk directly into the snow and suddenly it was like quicksand (I had to put it in Arizona terms.) My every move pushed me down further!\n\nAnd then Mark swiftly pulled up on the other side of the pole and picked up my glove without breaking a sweat, let alone trapping his entire body under snow. After several long minutes of struggling, I finally managed to pop my skis off and wriggle out of the snow, but getting them back ON while on the downhill slope was another issue.\n\nAfter we survived that adventure, I checked my phone to see our other three friends had sent a selfie: they were leisurely enjoying a hot chocolate at the Schwendi Hutte at the top of the mountain. Maybe we should have gone with them after all.\n\nMark and I decided we’d go down the mountain once more– one final hurrah– and then retire back to our cabin two hours early for après-ski. After all, there’s only so much skiing two West-coasters can handle, ESPECIALLY if one of them is a girl with red hair. The odds weren’t in my favor!\n\nNow, I’ve popped my skiing cherry and I’m ready to take on the world. When the city of Boston forgets to salt the sidewalks and they’re covered in ice and sludge, I’m not afraid! I’ll just pop on my skis and flex on these hoes.\n\n",

        "content": "In my life there are a handful of questions I’ve been stopped and asked about more than I’ve ever been asked out by a beautiful woman, so let me get those out of the way. \n\nNo, I don’t want to join your Bible study. \n\nYes, I’m aware that my collection of cardigans reminds you of your 10th grade English teacher. \n\nAnd yeah, I can recite the entirety of Justin’s _Believe_ album, start to finish.\n\nEach fleeting moment I spy a gorgeously gay gay walking past me, I hold my breath, because surely she can tell that I sleep below movie posters of _A League of Their Own_ and _Thelma and Louise_. But alas, no up and down glances, no immediate make out sessions, no chaining me down with carabiners. I’m passed by. \n\nI don’t want to say it’s my own fault that I’ve built up a brand on par with a mildly tempered southern woman, but I suppose it might be. Except this is simply who I am today, if I want answers, I need to dive deeper. What choice did I make in the past that bundled up this bursting rainbow?\n\nI decided to seek out answers, and as fate would have it, Comm Ave’s straight campus led me to them. Instead of being shoved meeting minutes from the LDS chapter on the street, I was shoved a card for professional help: Paul’s Fortune Telling. \n\nLate one evening, I crawled down to visit the mysterious fortune teller on Comm Ave, who everyone else similarly seemed to pass by during the day. He would understand me. With a reasonable donation of $30 USD, Paul was ready to read my palm. \n\n“Ah yes, just as I suspected, curved lines in every which way until one moment and they all became straight,” he pointed to the center of my hand. “You must have squandered something.” I looked down and traced my own finger across what he referred to. Oh god. How could I have never noticed?\n\n“Most of my clients who come to me with these hands attribute their passing qualities to the Second Industrial Revolution, with a cardigan just like that one.” He pointed to my outfit. What? This has to do with the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory?\n\n“It seems as though all domestic traits became permanently sealed inside your soul once the disaster occurred, explaining your current outward appearance today,” detailed the all knowing oracle. \n\n“But I can trace your lack of straightness to the fact that you were sewing a garment of blues and pinks and purples. How scandalous! Most people have a hard time spotting the early gays because all of the images from that time are grayscale.”\n\nIt all made sense now. My soul is closeted inside the 1911 industrial worker version of me.\n\n“Of course, I can recommend listening to Simon de Beauvoir on tape or carrying around a Rosie the Riveter pin, but those largely yield disappointing or pretentious results. I’m afraid you may have to persevere through this condition for the rest of your life.”\n\nAnd so I have. I will carry on the historic shield glued to my face.\n\nBut if you’ve made it this far, and you're into girls, and you see me doing Luda’s verse during Bieber karaoke, just know that those words could all be about you baby ;)\n\n\n",

        "description": "Warren towers security guards are sick and tired of students forgetting their IDs and ICE agents are no exception. Though the ancient ID slide technology is depressing (especially compared to the tap-scan EVERYWHERE ELSE) these security guards do not have it easy, especially in the new age of ICE invasions. ",
        "content": "Warren towers security guards are sick and tired of students forgetting their IDs and ICE agents are no exception. Though the ancient ID slide technology is depressing (especially compared to the tap-scan EVERYWHERE ELSE) these security guards do not have it easy, especially in the new age of ICE invasions. \n\nFirst and foremost, ICE agents and BU students look almost identical. Clunky black outfits are not just the stylish option for the agents, but also the preferred day-off look for the ex-emo kids that make up all of COM. How are the security guards supposed to differentiate a hoard of intoxicated teenagers versus a hoard of equally intoxicated 40 year old Trump supporters? \n\nWarren tower’s security guard Cekure Gward (pronounced secure guard) said “I remember the ICE agents from the 80’s, their outfits were much more recognizable. This job isn’t what it used to be. I’m going to have to retire soon if I keep letting those agents in. You know what they say, 64 strikes and your out!” \n\nGward has been the cause of 63 prior ICE invasions on campus. If Gward’s actions continue, the impacts that the ICE agents have on campus may become detrimental. \n\nNot only do the ICE agents pose a threat to students and staff, but the construction on Warren Towers simply cannot support the weight of an extended ICE group. For those who have been misinformed, an official full ICE team is accompanied by an entire scuba diving team (in case an immigrant tries to swim across the charles and the normal ICE members forgot their bathing suits), personal chefs to meet the energy-providing vegan gluten free diet of the agents, and small instrumental ghoulish entities that provide an exhilarating soundtrack to the gang’s misdeeds. With the scuba divers, chefs, and ghouls alike, Warren’s weight capacity may be at risk. \n\nIn a similar sense, the agents pose a threat to the building’s ancient plumbing. If security guards continue to let these oversized groups into Warren towers, not only do we risk deportation of our dear friends, but also the internal integrity of the Towers. Imagine the chefs cook up some bad immigrant for the ICE agents, then each of them will require an entire floor’s bathroom and override the pipe system causing explosive bursts. \n\nAccording to ICE agent 093 “Yeah, I think my favorite part about being on the team is community… I remember one time after we infiltrated that aquarium we swam with the dolphins.” \nNot only do the agents get in the way of students craving that dining hall gruel, but the agents also pose a serious carcinogenic threat to student health. Fact: Both hotdogs and cigarettes are classified as group 1 carcinogens, however a hotdog takes 36 minutes off of your life while a cigarette only takes off 20. We know that BU students have spent a long time cultivating a healthy relationship with their nicotine, averaging -1 hr off their life per day. But when we add the ICE agent hotdog eating fee into the equation, student’s risk shortening their lives up to 2 weeks. During an ICE raid, agents will forcefully make arrests in which they show victims really un-funny instagram reels, read aloud texts, and impose a hotdog eating tax. If BU students aren’t getting their normal dosage of cigarettes but are instead getting replaced with hotdogs, the current student body may not make it to graduation.\n\nIt would be great to support the community of ICE agents at Warren Towers, but BU’s team of security guards does not get paid enough to work around the ICE agent’s lack of student IDs. If the ICE agents REALLY need to come and wreck our plumbing, structural integrity and human relationships, then they can enroll at the university and pay for an ID like everyone else. \n",

A glare so fierce it was burning a hole into the table. </p>\n\n<p><div class=\"indent-1\">Speaking of burning holes: can we talk about how the republicans have been taking over Grindr? It all started after big seesta general lost the election. The app in which I trolled grown men and where I got the hottest new gossip was promoting an extremely conservative agenda. All of the he/they baristas suddenly turned into faceless profiles saying they’re going to end the woke mob! Oh dearest diary, I was so shocked! I was so shocked that I sent an email to the Grindr HQ and received an auto reply stating that RFK had acquired all of Grindr and they’re going to make major changes. First one being that all “DL masc4masc” profiles had priority access to not only the Cowboy Carter Tour, but also to Dragcon 2025! How dare Grindr allow those shirtless profiles to have access when they can’t even appreciate the opulence of Joella’s episode 4 look? It’s been especially hard since they’ve let the Log Cabin republicans take ownership of the FDA (which surprisingly is also owned by Grindr). They’re replacing all the nutrition labels on my low fat yogurt with the word “Stats?” and “Looking?” Oh Mamala Harris please come back and save Grindr! Please big seesta general we need you as bad as ever! The republican DL’s have become as picky as ever. Before, they just said “no fats, no fems” but now they’re blocking you if you even mention that you eat processed foods! They’ve even fired Katya from the Grindr podcast and replaced her with the insurrection grandma. Which honestly is a change I’m ok with but I feel bad for that haggard old woman (Katya). </div></p>\n\n<p>\tPlease save my favorite app. </p>\n",

If you’re one of the many trans folks struggling to access or afford top surgery, take a trip up north to experience a no-cost uniquely New England-based solution.  Let the wintery weather freeze your tits right off!\n\nNow, you know I wouldn’t recommend something to all you faithful Pinky readers if I didn’t know it worked, so take my testimony as proof: it happened to me!  One minute, I was walking down Comm Ave with the back problems of a well-endowed bad bitch, and the next, I was hit with a gust of wind so goddamn cold it froze my tits straight off!  They fell to the ground and shriveled into teeny tiny remnants of what they once were, much like the Democratic party’s balls every time trans rights came up during the election.  As I watched my frozen tits roll weakly into the gutter, I was inspired. I realized I had to share my newfound freedom with the rest of the world who doesn’t experience nip-numbing temperatures as a normal part of their everyday life.\n\nHere’s my foolproof method for how you, too, can ditch your double D’s for free via freezing.  Step into your best recreation of the New England man uniform (work boots, poorly-fitting jeans, and a stained hoodie that’s so old it’s holding on for dear life) and find yourself a good wind tunnel.  This is best done with an iced coffee in hand, to replace the energy you’ll lose from your tits (it’s science).  Then, simply stand with your arms out, and wait for the winter wind to hit you square in the chest.  Don’t let the cold burn deter you!  The numbness will set in in a few minutes anyways, and then it’ll be nothing.  And that’s it!  The New England wind is so nippy, it’ll have your nips jumping ship!\n\nYou’re probably asking yourself if this method is safe.  Allow me to assure you: it’s free.\n\nNew England weather is known for its extremes.  Our winters can go from being as frigid as Melania Trump watching a small child cry for its mother to as mild as the salsa at your favorite gentrified taqueria in a day.  So, be sure to check the weather when you plan your trip so that you can experience those blustery wind blasts that will blow your boobs right into oblivion!  Remember, much like the “debate” on trans rights, New England weather has no middle ground.\n\nSo come freeze your tits off, and at no cost to you, your chest can be flatter than the promises of corporations to support the LGBTQ+ community fell once Trump took office!",

There is a darkness that surrounds you. “I think we’re moving too fast,” haunts your dreams. You hear “I thought we were just having fun” whenever the wind blows.\n\nNothing feels real anymore and you have no clue what to do. It almost feels impossible the way you keep his name in your mouth (pause). But why does he only insist on seeing you after dark? The fast and loose flirting could give anyone whiplash. This is torture. Something has got to give.\n\nHe has to pay, the voices say one morning. He can’t keep getting away with this. You begin to agree with them.

We must cleanse the Earth of his sins.\n\nHe plays right into your trap one night. He never even sees it coming. The heavy snowfall, a walk in the Commons. \n\nHow romantic. The voices are almost screaming. But no matter, you just grip his hand tighter and smile even wider.\n\nNo one even hears him scream. How unfortunate, the voices say as his blood stains the white snow.\n\n“He ruins everything,” you say back, pulling him towards the frozen pond. It’s easy to break through the layer of ice. It’s easy to hack into his bones. It’s easy to drop chunks of him into the water one by one, watching them sink to the bottom. They’ll come back up eventually, but at least no one will see the pieces of him until everything melts. \n\nAnd that will take weeks, the voices hum with delight.\n\nYou don’t drop everything though. You take a finger, and put it in a jar. It’s almost gray now from the cold. Pure enough. Detached from him.\n\nThere’s a new voice now. It sounds strangely familiar. And every time it speaks, you shake the jar as hard as you can.tf\n\nSituationships, ha ha! They can drive you pretty crazy!",

YOU WOULD THINK IF THE PLACE WAS GONNA GO UP IN FLAMES WE WOULD ALL BE DEAD BY THE END OF THE WARNING SIGNAL. \n\n\n“There is an emergency in the building. Please wait to hear a beep for evacuation.”\n\n\nI must think fast, I can not let the firefighters see this. What if they are hot and hunky like in the porn video I was watching?? I throw the rose toy into my roommate's nasty molding tea kettle she hasn’t washed in weeks, get my nearest pair of pants on, and waddle out of my room with burns on my legs feeling alarmed. \n\n\nI will be honest, no one found out it was me THANK GOD. But, I forgot I put the rose toe in the kettle… and I think my roommate just made tea.",

        "content": "\tWhen I joined the Pinky Toe, things were good. Sleepy Joe was in office, Kamala was campaigning her way through fall, and I thought I was making waves. I’ll be honest, I was riding the high of my acceptance. I set off to prove that straight men can (also) do it. I remember sitting down at Trident Bookstore after perusing my favorite authors, Angela Davis and bell hooks, ordering a matcha latte with strawberry syrup, and putting my pen to paper. The words flowed in waves, like feminism, and landed perfectly on the page, as I undid centuries of patriarchal rule over women and queer people (We’re sorry🙏). \n\n\tBut now, all of this is in danger. As I watched the election, all I could think about was the oppressed communities who would be affected by this (yeah that’s right, im woke and intersectional). But more importantly, I thought about us, the straight cis het men. All the progress that our community had made for ages and ages. We accepted that others had feelings, we finally understood that it was ok to cry (which I totally did on election night), we finally began to really understand. \n\nWith DEI under crosshairs of the impending Tump administration, I knew what it meant. It meant that we would no longer occupy- I mean represent ourselves within queer/feminist spaces.  I hoped that in the days between the election, one of the straightest men of all time could save us. He, and only he, could enshrine DEI to preserve. Joe Biden. Instead tho, he just preemptively pardoned his family and, as any straight white cis-het man in his position would do, funded Israel. So when Donald came into office and basically deleted DEI, I knew it was over for me, a minority of every kind in the Pinky Toe (straight, male, Latino and Asian). Now that DEI is done, and it’s only a matter of time before BU removes the HTC, a huge blow has been dished out to the straight man community, specifically me cuz I'm being kicked out of Pinky Teo too.\n\nI was lucky to arrive at the Pinky toe when I did. Brat summer was lowkey still going, the leaves were changing colors, me still wide eyed and dreaming of us straights showing that we have changed. Us men deserve to read and be in the Pinky Toe aren’t unqualified; we get your humor too! We secretly love watching clips of Caleb Heron, we also have Lady gaga on our gym playlists, and yes we can also do funny campy humor. \n\nSo to all (5) the straight male readers who read my work, thank you, and our day will come.\n\nIt’s been real, Martín (he/him/his) ",

        "content": "It’s weird. I keep hearing people completely freaking out but whenever I try to find out what’s causing the ruckus, they look at me funny and say “The Bird Flu.”\n\n\tBut like um yeah, they do that?\n\n\tWell, not all birds do I suppose. According to my research, there are around 60 species of flightless birds. You have ostriches, penguins, kiwis. Domesticated chickens are unable to fly for extended periods of time, so I’m still unsure if they would fall under these people’s worries. \n\n\tAnd their bodies are just built like that. They have hollow bones! I must assume the dislike of it comes from their own personal agenda: a hatred of woodwind instruments. Because yeah, they did make flutes out of bird bones once upon a time, and they were cool! But stop fretting, if they’re flying, the bones remain in their bodies and we don’t have to deal with that horrendous music. You’re safe as long as Bird Flu stays around.\n\n\tIn my personal opinion, I don’t think we should be worried about this “The Bird Flu.” They can’t help flying more than a frat brother can’t help screaming into a party “if you’re not a brother or sleeping with a brother, GET OUT.” It’s just the way the world works. Ultimately, I think there should be more “bird flu.” Honestly, let’s add more animals into the mix and accept flying squirrel flu. Hell, bats can fly too! A bat flu would be totally awesome.\n\n\tAnd don’t even get me started on the illiteracy rate of the US. They keep misspelling “bird flew.” It’s honestly kinda embarrassing for them. Don’t talk about a subject you know nothing about.\n",

        "content": " Trump announced DEI is being reinstated and renamed to Donald and Elon Intercourse.\n\nPUBLISHING THIS ANONYMOUSLY \n\nFrom Elon’s POV:\n\nDo you think he thinks about me like how I think about him? How often  I think about him? I wish I were Santa Claus so it isn’t considered “weird” when I watch him when he’s sleeping. How I know he’s awake. Certainly how I know if he’s been bad or good. I get these feelings when I see him. Feelings I’ve never felt for a man before. Confusing feelings. Let me describe this in detail. When I see him I get all hot. I forget whatever I was thinking about. A few times I have looked down to see my little piggy perking up. I know Trump gets those.. He tells me all about these models. He sleeps around a lot. Did you know Barron isn’t Melania’s?? Anyways, he tells me about when his little piggy perks up. I think he calls them insurrections. I wonder if he gets them when he sees me.\n\n** In woeful manhattan **\n\n“Hey there little mama,” Trump says.\n\n“Hehe hey,” I say as I kick my feet.\n\n“Do you wanna play MarioCart with me?” Trump asks.\n\n“You know I do!” I unintentionally say in a high-pitched squeal.\n\nWe race our way up the stairs. I don't know if it was on purpose or not but, the back of his hand slightly skimmed my thigh. I don’t know what to think when he does stuff like this. Maybe it’s just wishful thinking. I don't know. I don't know. I just.. just wish it were obvious. Last week I asked if he wanted to ride my rocket ship.. He called the presidential helicopter to take us to space x. \n\n“Do you want the bare remote controller or the steering wheel one?” Donny asks me.\n\nHe genuinely cares about my feelings. I think this is a good sign. I stumble over my words, but I finally get out\n\n“Whichever.” \n\nI’d definitely be submissive. He take the wheel and says\n\n“Great cause I was gonna take this one either way.”\n\nWe play for about ten minutes until I get a text that Dean Withers tweeted on X. I screech. This damn boy is so annoying. Delete account, I click. Donald looks over and asks me if I am okay. I tell him that I wish the libs would just stop trying. He comforts me. He puts one hand on my back and rubs it gently. I look down to see him caressing my lower thigh. His hand slowly getting higher and higher. I can feel his body slowly press up against mine and I can feel his breath getting heavier. \n\n“You’re so pretty,” Donald whispers in my ear. He whispers it so slowly and gently. In an image, it would be depicted by a beautiful flower being carefully tilted by a gentle breeze. My heart is rushing. \n\n“I really want you” He follows with. My heart is pounding so fast. I can hardly breathe. I realize I have an insurrection. I decided to put my hands on him. I run them up and down his spine. I feel him perk up. I notice his little piggy has perked up too. He lays me down on the floor pushing the remotes out of the way. The gold plated floors chill my back as he aggressively takes off my shirt. Finally, I know he feels the same. He grabs his phone and turns on his sex playlist.\n\n\n\nHe connects it to the speaker and gets to business. He rips off my belt. What he does next.. so unholy that christians everywhere should be counting their blessings that he didn't put his hand on the bible during his inauguration. He takes my belt, loops one side through the buckle, puts my hands on either side of this belt which is now shaped like an 8, and tightens it. Now that he has fashioned my belt as handcuffs around my wrists I know for sure I was right about being a sub. I was so right. I honestly didn't expect to be this right. I cannot believe this is about to happen. \n\n“It is time. I’m gonna do it,” Donny Wonny announced. He slips it in. \n\nWriters note: Being accepted to Boston University to write smut about Donald Trump and Elon Musk is deeply saddening. I am not writing this in detail. We are skipping to the end.\n\nAfter about \n\nHe stands up and goes to eat a twinkie. He looks so good eating that twinkie. I stand up and ask him where the bathroom is. He told me to keep walking until I found it. \n “Hehe!” I giggle. He is so cute and funny and he makes me wanna prance around. \n\n\nI am ending this here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But they’re getting a lot of publicity about that recently so lets hold space for me instead. </p><p>I thought about a spa day or a nice massage but then it came to me. What could be more relaxing than a bubbly, dill-infused fermentation period! Instructions on this recipe say to begin with a nice mason jar that’s clear enough to check on your progress. This week I’ll be using the BUild lab as my container of choice! It’s transparent and clearly labeled so i wont get lost in the fridge. </p><p>Next, I’ll be using a brining liquid of 1 part water, 1 part vinegar, blah blah blah fuck this recipe why are you telling me what to do?? Today I’ll be adding 400 litres of Charles River water, however much salt is on the sidewalks, and battery acid from all the smoke detectors across campus because I like a pickle with a real sour bite. And of course some fresh dill! </p><p>As I slip into the green, cold, somewhat chunky (I think the batteries were expired) I feel an instant wave of relaxation wash over me. I can feel healing properties of mercury seeping into me, the gut-biome-fluencer on wellness-tok was telling me all about them. I sink to the bottom and feel the dill tickle my toes and the soothing salt exfoliation begin eroding my bunions away. </p><p>Yes. I’m sure. This is exactly what I needed. I feel better already. I paddle through the chartreuse colored waves and seal the lab up. Air would hinder the fermentation process and make me a floppy, acrid, spoiled mess. </p><p>Once I get bubbly and the green seeps into my skin enough to make me sour yet refreshingly sharp and witty, take me out and enjoy on a nice juicy burger, gluten free tuna melt, fruit roll up with chamoy, or just maybe a sunny Boston day.</p>",

        "content": "I check X Twitter before I head to class, as one does, when I’m confronted by set photos and videos of a movie. Nothing new, people love to share pictures of irrelevant movies and whatnot. But what really got my attention was the caption:\n\nRobert Pattinson and Zendaya Spotted filming their new movie in Boston\n\nBut wait, I’m in Boston. I could run into Edward himself! Or even better, Ms. Rocky Blue herself! Yet how could I build a genuine pre-planned casual run-in with her? She’s a star and I’m but a lowly college students with no money, no prospects, and a burden to my parents.\n\nYet as I continue to scroll, I come across another video of Zendaya in Boston. As I analyze the video, I see the restaurant she’s at: Tatte. Of course, Zandaya fucking loves a good Tatte run. She ate there with her – at the time – new boyfriend Tom Holland last time she filmed in town.\n\nWith that in mind, I packed my bags and took residency at my nearest Tatte, a 5 minute walk from my dorm on Beacon St. I set up hidden cameras everywhere and clicked between them like I was playing a game of Five Nights at Freddy’s. Only it was more sadistic since there was no Foxy in sight.\n\nYet after 3 days of camping out, eating only stale croissants and diluted coffee while missing classes, I had to call it quits. Why would Zendaya ever be on a street as dumb as Beacon? I had to leave for my own sake. That and the employees finally found me and ran me out with a broom like a raccoon.\n\nAs I did what essentially felt like a walk of shame back to my dorm, I had an epiphany – Celebrities are nothing more than people. They struggle to find the hooks on the back of their bras just like me. These parasocial relationships we’ve developed with certain famous people are a disease and we have to be more conscious about how we treat people. In the end, I don’t actually mind that Zendaya never showed up because I was able to keep my dignity as a person and-\n\nRoomie: “Y’know, Zendaya was shooting scenes in the building across the street from our dorm.”\n\nY’know, there’s another Tatte by Fenway Target that I can camp out in…\n\n",

        "content": "Tortilla. Speckled Egg. Ugly Irish person. These are all measly insults that villains have spewed at me while I walk down the street as an extremely pale skinned individual. Oh how they laugh, oh how they cry. “Look at you! Spread on some sunscreen, freak!” What they don’t know is that my freckles, sprinkled far and wide across my face, give me UNGODLY power, like a solar panel fueled by Greta Thunberg’s motivational speeches.\nI take these attacks with a cheeky smile, because I hold a secret that not one other soul knows. For every spot that emerges on my fair husk, I acquire a new portal to the past, where I travel to different decades and places warning folks about the high risks that come with not protecting themselves from the big ball in the sky. I keep a top-secret suitcase with me, stock full of sample sized Sun Bum, La-Roche Posay, and Neutrogena tubes. While it may seem that I am exhibiting great cognitive dissonance by not wearing sunscreen just so I can gain various entrances into history, it is a sacrifice I am willing to make for the good of all skin health and my own eyeballs. I am sick and tired of my professors clicking through slides and being APPALLED by crusty, musty, and dusty portraits. My grades suffered because I could only focus on the lack of moisture in JFK's pores, although I do understand now that when I visited him, perhaps I should have provided more advice than just CeraVe.\nWhen night settles in, I crawl into a tiny little corner, bury my head and begin the ritual. “Spots on!” I whisper. At once, my beauty marks begin to glow, lighting up like a glittering sky. At random, one special dot beams extra brightly and my entire body compresses into a tiny ray, surging like a lightning bolt across time. It feels like someone jump started a car, and at once, I pop out into a random era. Some experiences have been more rewarding than others.\nThe furthest I have traveled back to is definitely the Prehistoric Era, where I helped a lowly band of velociraptors with their creamy applications. This experience was one of the most challenging, but only because their scales had complications with absorbing the preventatives. Velociraptors are actually quite receptive to heat protection. In fact, they were begging for me not to leave, basically pleading for more and more samples to help with burns. Turns out, it just wasn’t enough.\nI also vividly remember visiting the woman in the Dorthea Lange picture from the Great Depression. I couldn’t lessen the impact of a failing economy but I could lessen the impact of the ozone holes! She was not super grateful for the addition of random products on her face and kept asking “Why are you giving me a banana-strawberry scented paste instead of an actual banana or a strawberry?” I could only think to say that she would feel just as fulfilled knowing that millions of people in the future will complement her complexion for its smooth texture.\nMy most recent stop was with Helen Keller. To my great surprise, she was actually real. To my even greater surprise, she was already a huge proponent of skin protection. I guess that when you lose ⅖ of your senses, the others become really sensitive so the sun was already very much on her radar. Because she was already ahead of the game, I used my power to spend time developing a brand with Helen. When we released the first product, You Can’t See Me translucent sunscreen, the world went bonkers as they could now achieve that effortless glow from sun safety. Her line was such a hit that we quickly followed up with more lotion variations, including You Can’t Hear Me (UV is the Silent Killer), I Can’t Speak (I’m Applying My Sunscreen), and I Don’t Fake It (This is My Real Skin).\nI am proud of the impact I have made, reducing electromagnetic induced risks for folks every day. Maybe someday, the world will be cured and I can finally try out what I’ve preached all these years.\nSpots off.\n",

        "content": "So You Call Yourself An Activist? STOP WASHING YOUR SHEETS!\nBy Ava Carrel\n\nAs I walk down the bustling street of comm ave and dodge a near body slam by the flaming red backpack of a rower on a scooter, I think about how much the city of boston has changed from my plethora of rich memories as a local 16 years ago (I lived in basically Rhode Island for 6 months). Me, my bottle of breastmilk, and poopy stinky diaper were regulars at historic spots such as Off the Wall Kidz Park and Boston just doesn't make drinks like they did anymore. Like any major city in America right now, Boston is facing issues like gentrification, skyrocketing rent, and homelessness. Everyone’s aware of the rising homeless community in Dorchester and Roxbury but we don’t even acknowledge as Boston University students commit VIOLENT GENOCIDE to the most marginalized community of all: The Bacteria colony in your sheets.\n\n\tThe Bacteria colony’s indigenous lands are located in the bottom fold of your covers, right next to the void where the socks you kick off in the middle of the night become lost to the world. The Bacteria have a rich culture filled with joy, love, and the traditions that hundreds of generations have passed down. That yellowing patch on the corner that you called “fucking nasty” (Tell me, how does it feel to yell slurs with no shame?) was a mural honoring Binary Fission, the asexual reproduction process of bacterial growth. Yup, you just invalidated asexuality and are now cursed with 7 years of bimonthly UTIs. Washing your sheets seizes The Bacteria’s ancestral homelands in what your propaganda calls “weekly wash!” but is really a political power coup. You thought January 6th was bad? Your fabric softener is worse. And bleach? Unethical, inhumane, torture, must i continue? To put it simply, Obama dropped bombs on civilians but you dissolved an entire family with $3.50 and a tide pod. Say it with me now: LAND BACK!\n\n\tThe displacement of The Bacteria colonies is a dire crisis and there are only so many resources for them to turn to when you ethnically cleanse their cultures and kick them out onto the street. My bed in Sleeper Hall, ninth floor and take a right out of the elevators, has become a shelter to house these refugees. I am 2 months into my freshman year of college and I have taken on the brave and noble responsibility of breaking societal norms and refusing to wash my sheets. Have I faced immense backlash? Yes. My roommate weeps gently to sleep every night as the border of bacteria slowly creeps closer and closer to her side. Have the masses tried to shame and shun me? Yes. Even the so-called “leftist” commies from the “History of Communism” class that I tried to convince to burn their laundry bags abandoned their marxist rhetoric when faced with the apparent dilemma of wash or not wash. Genocide or live up to the “wokeness” you claim to have.\n\n\tOf course this new living arrangement isn’t all fun and games. The Bacteria colony needs ample food and sweat to survive and grow. Every night I go to fit-rec and pick a roller hockey boy’s backpack to steal and wear one of those reflective sauna suits as they chase me around the rink for 45 minutes. Once I can feel the water pooling up to my knees in the suit, I brake check roller hockey boy and the student section goes crazy as they slam into the wall! I wring out my pushup bra into a petri dish to give to The Bacteria in solidarity with their efforts for political autonomy. All this working out has got me pretty toned; soon I'll not only be a giving, noble, kind ass person, but I'll have the gyatt to go with it.\n\n\tThe world saw the sign in your lawn in 2020: “SILENCE IS VIOLENCE”. We saw the black square post too. I know it’s still in your archive, so don’t try and hide. So unless you’re ready to be the newest cancelee that we will be holding accountable through death threats, public instagram shaming, and yeast infections: join the revolution and STOP WASHING YOUR SHEETS.\n\n",

        "content": "First and foremost I would like to extend my thanks to my dear roommate Abby. Her fascination with scientology is truly one to be admired.  Yes, I know how that sounds…but fear not\\! They’re not gonna get her\\!\\!\\! I WON’T let them. To lose my dear Abby (okayyy dear abbeys reference. They were recently on my tik tok fyp and I got just a little bit scared\\!) to those freaks would be the tragedy of a lifetime. Yes, the offer of a free personality test is tempting to the astrologically inclined, but if anyone can evade the grasps of the church of scientology’s sticky little fingers, it’s her.\n\nAbby is the one who first put this idea into my head. We were waiting for the T late one night, trekking home to our west campus abode after an unsuccessful journey on which we were unable to find either the northern lights OR Mr. Beast. What a night that was. Anyways. We were standing there as we do and she pondered out loud, “Hmmm. I wonder if the Scientologists can cure my ligma.” And oh boy did I spring to my feet\\! How had I never thought of this? I’d searched far and wide, high and low for a cure for my, nay, OUR affliction, to no avail. My valiant efforts came up inconclusive. Until now, that is…\n\nListen. Say what you will about scientology, but those sons of bitches sure do know how to answer a question. That’s like their whole deal. I think. Who’s to say\\! Are their answers good? Well no\\! Do they make sense? Well…no\\! But I’ll take any answers I can get. And who in the world could have more knowledge, more sage wisdom than Xenu him(her? Their? it?)self, dictator of the Galactic Confederacy. I sat him down for a little conversation and believe you me, if I could share with you the wisdom that Xenu graciously imparted upon me, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I fear you must reach Operating Thetan Level III ☹. I mean I’ll try, but read at your own risk, you MIGHT die spontaneously of pneumonia. That would be a bummer.\nThis is what he told

But why just talk when we can express our feelings through a different method. The suburban wine moms shouldn’t be the only ones who get to partake in paint n sips. That’s why I’m proposing: Paint n shit\nAnd no we’re not buzzfeed, we won’t be painting with our shit.\nInstead of a normal studio, the pinkies can sit on portable potties just in case nature calls. No need to stop your artistic streak just because you need to fight your demons.\nPossible drinks served could be:\nSextuple espresso martinis for the much needed coffee shits\nMiralax cocktails\nPepto bismol smoothies\nAlka seltzer shots\nLaxative lattes\nAnd with a variety of items to choose from to paint to express your deepest self:\nSeptic tanks\nColostomy bags\nBidets\nToilet seat covers\nSquatty potties\nOr bring your own! Just make sure to clean it first pretty please\nThe artwork you produce at your local paint n shit is perfect for the upcoming holiday season-\nIt’ll make the perfect gift for your nephew who is potty training or for your doctor after your next colonoscopy.\nDefinitely something that should be in the works for future semesters.\n\n\n",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">We Are Not the Same: You Poop Till You’re Done, I Poop Till My Leg Falls Asleep<br>By Doran Steinfeld<br><br>Hello, Pinky-Nation. As a writer for an honest publication that cares about honest journalism, I feel that I should come clean and be as transparent as I can when writing this article.<br>‍<br>For starters, I am currently on the toilet as I write this. I could give photo evidence, but even I have some limits when it comes to what I’m willing to put on the internet under my name. And I’ve done some crazy things! Just read my articles, and you’ll be enchanted by my IDGAFness (unless you’re trying to hire me… but it’s okay if you’re trying to hire me for, like, a comedy thing or something, in which case - hire me pls :3). <br>‍<br>I am also actively molting into my third phase, and will finish the hatching process in 2 half-moon cycles. You know, just girly things. <br>‍<br>But this is neither here nor there. This is toilet time, and mine is way more special and fantastical than yours could ever be. </p><p id=\"\">‍<br>For starters: it hurts. My best friend Olga Syphil always used to tell me that “if it hurts, that’s how you know it’s good.” I speak of her in the past tense not because she is dead (you wish! She’s an 8th dimensional being, she can’t die lol), but because I have free will, and don’t you forget it. Back to my poopy time; it hurts, which means there will always be great reward for the pain I endure. Half the time. Scratch that, more like a quarter. Ehhhhh, maybe an eighth. <br>‍<br>It’s also a little frightful. If there’s one thing everyone knows about me, it's that I love a good spook. “You know Doran, oh, how he loves his little spooks!” And that I do. Sitting on the toilet is a scary thing. Ever since I grew the imagination bone in the brain, I started imagining horrible things like giant spiders crawling up the tube and snatching at my buttocks. It adds a sense of edge and suspense to the experience; will I get clawed, or will I evade the imaginary creature yet again?<br>‍<br>I also just have celiac disease. I’m not explaining this again. If you still don’t know what this is, go read my other article and come back. Are my shitstorms always celiac reactions? Probably not, but with all that celiac disease has taken from me, I think it’s more than fair for me to take a little back by using it as an excuse. #yesibelievethatequity&gt;equality<br>‍<br>And oop! It’s about that time. I’ve been sitting here for so long (writing this) that my left leg is starting to feel a tingly sensation. It’s falling asleep! Now, a normal person would take this as a sign to stop and come back another time, but we are not the same. I’m only halfway (if that!) through my movement, and I have an article to write. Sorry left leg, looks like you’re gonna have to wait. Maybe right leg will join you soon? <br>‍<br>Sitting here, I do find myself in a pickle. I feel that there is more, and yet, nothing is coming out (#welcometotrump’samerica😔). This is when I would pull out the squatty potty, and get to work. However, I’m a college student living on Buswell. I have no such thing. But I do have a trash can. Time to kick off the pants, put those grippers on the edge, and lean forward in horrible posture. <br>‍<br>BOOM! It’s working. Haha. Knew it. I’m a pro. <br><br>But wait…<br><br>Uh oh….<br><br>The tingling has only gotten worse. My left leg is practically buzzing. In my mind, it’s just buzzing with excitement, because it knows that this is going to work, but what if…<br><br>No. I have no time to waste. It’s the last full week of school. I have shit to do, and not enough time to do it. I must finish this battle and move on to another one. And there’s only one way to do that.<br><br>Push. <br><br>And push.<br><br>And clench!<br><br>And then push.<br><br>PLOP!<br><br>I look down to see my creation. <br><br>Hold on. Something’s wrong.<br><br>That’s not a glorious mountain of excrement….<br><br>It’s a copy of my Apple Music Replay! Here are my stats! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Side note: I am mad. HOW is there barely any Janelle Monáe in my top albums, despite the fact that she’s my top artist and takes up most of my top songs (trust. The top 100 is filled with her.)? I have an evil theory. I bet that Apple Music doesn’t consider it an “album listen” if you don’t go to the actual album and click play, which I think is stupid, because when I listen to Janelle Monáe, I go to my playlist titled “literally janelle monáe’s entire discography in order” and click on the first song of the album I want to listen to. WHERE IS ARCHANDROID ON MY LIST APPLE MUSIC!!! <br><br></p>",

So tell me why last week I got covid for the fifth fucking time last week since 2022! Where am I going wrong, who have I double crossed? There is only one obvious explanation: it's the queer agenda.\n\nI discovered the truth after doing research on my two most trusted sources: facebook and reddit, and I've cracked the code. The chemicals in GSU Panda Express are exactly infused with chemicals that slowly make you gayer. Ever wonder why that one girl friend who used to swear up and down she's straight was caught kissing girls after her break up? The chemicals! Sauce from the orange chicken actually contains miniature nanobots that travel up your spinal cord and turn on everytime you look at someone of the same gender. They transplant ungodly thoughts into your brain using vibrations, why do you think there have been so many mullets cut on campus this year?\n\nNow you may be asking, how does this connect to you getting covid. Well after hiring a PI that I found on reddit I realized that some gay people on the BU campus are actually government plants. That situationship of yours: can not be trusted! After you pass out in their bed even though you probably shouldn’t, they are injecting you with an addictive variant of The Covid. First you get dangerously sick, then the high fever  makes you vulnerable to the gay enzymes multiplying in your blood stream. Why do you think youre still obsessed with that situationship who won't text you back? Think! Research! You are the victim of bio hacking!\n\n\n",

        "description": "Canon Powershot A630 left us with this quote;“ our SD cards are full, double A batteries are dying, and our flashes are weak; this abuse without proper compensation cannot go on”. ",
        "content": "Boston, MA - Monday, November 3rd Digicams across the country expressed their dissatisfaction with their working conditions after many were forced to do double overtime following the two halloweekends this year.\n\nThe double halloweekend this year didn't just send stupid freshmen to the hospital, a record high of digicam hospitalization has sent the digicam community into uproar. According to Beth-Israel hospital, they reported a 54% increase in digicam hospitalization. Dr. Poop, a digicam specialist, says that the increase in hospitalization may be due to a higher frequency of digicam being “willy nilly” on drunk girls' wrists.\n\n“The digicam community really doesn't have the capacity in their wrist straps to handle this usage” says Dr. Poop.\n\nIn response to this, Digicams across the country has threatened to unionize because of this abuse. A Canon Powershot A630 has emerged as the head of this movement to unionize, calling for the formation of the UNited States Union of Digital Cameras. “For too long we’ve been under the control of drunk college girls, and it's time for us to take control over our bodies,” says A630.\n\nThe USUDG stated that they will be boycotting until their demands for fair compensation are met. “We want at least 64GB memory cards and to be kept in secured purses from here on out” says A630. This boycott will include refusing to turn on their flashes at frat parties until demands are met.\n\nDigicams have been met with a lot of support from other cameras. The film camera union says “as fellow victims of abuse for peoples instagrams, we sympathize with Digicams and propose a mutual coalition of support”.  However, the future of the Union is up in the air after the Nov. 5th election.\n\nThis strike has disrupted many college girls nights out this past weekend, leading to talks about accepting a potential contract. Ultimately, this movement marks one of the most successful attempts at unionization in the past decade. A630 left us with this quote;“ our SD cards are full, double A batteries are dying, and our flashes are weak; this abuse without proper compensation cannot go on”.\n\n\n\n",

She had many other critiques towards the quality of the product and it’s obvious that she just doesn’t like her cheese drippy the way some of us do.\n\tMost recently she has reported Mr. Beast to the FBI for her concerns over inappropriate messages exchanged between him and his staff. Rosanna has put an incredible amount of time into slandering the good name of Mr. Beast. I ask you dear reader, how could a person with so much money ever be bad? People only get that much money because they treat people fairly and deserve it!\n\tDespite all of this, Rosanna, person to person I’m asking you for one thing. Ever since that fake post about Mr. Beast visiting BU, it has been my dream to meet him. I was absolutely devastated to learn that I had been misled and misinformed about his visit by social media. If the FBI takes him away then President Gilliam will never let him set foot on the hallowed grounds of our sacred school. Think about the lives of the BU students who you are affecting with your unfair and defaming actions. Please, grow a heart and some compassion for the young adults whose dreams lie in your hands.\n",

It’s my dingy Canon PowerShot that I got in 2013. Honestly, I’m not even meant to be here.

But as it turns out, I had actually broken one of the cameras he owned on a drunken night out months prior so this was really just his way of cursing me as revenge.

Aubrey Plaza as Voldemort as Death (see <em id=\"\">Figure 1</em>.) has yet to come collect my dead soul, and I am still on this mortal plane (for now. Once I figure out how to escape to IDGAFtopolis, it’s over for you bitches).&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">To be honest, I don’t understand these allegations. I’ve never even played dead (it’s not funny. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEqyLxV-Z3I\" id=\"\">Don’t joke about that.</a>) However when I do some inner reflection and think about all the amazing things I’ve done for the world, one slight hiccup comes to mind. The time that I killed myself. I think that perhaps people heard this and just made the giant crazy assumption leap that I was dead, even though I ONLY DID IT ONCE!!! It’s ludicracy and defamation, and you know what they say about what happens when you assume: nothing at first, but then Prime Olga Syphil will rip open a portal into our universe and stick her hand so far up your ass that it can slap your face (because it’s up in there too!), so….</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Now, some of you may be asking, how is it possible that you survived your suicide? And to that, I have one simple answer: hatred. I am a hater at heart, and a hater at mouth. Just like Maul from <em id=\"\">Star Wars</em>, I can survive anything, as long as I have hatred to fuel me. Who’s the hatred for? If you’re asking this question, it’s you. Stop being so fucking nosy and be more like Aubrey Plaza as Voldemort as Death (see <em id=\"\">Figure 1.</em>) and serve nosyless face and cunt. Unless you’re Jewish, then it’s okay. It’s our culture - that’s why I’m allowed to be nosy and you’re not (but you’re not allowed to call me nosy - I’m not). /srs. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEqyLxV-Z3I\" id=\"\">Don’t joke about that.</a> Enjoy this photo of an odd pole I found in South Boston Waterfront (see <em id=\"\">Figure 2.</em>).&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">I know you dumbfucks reading this probably don’t know where to look for the photos.

It was 9:00 AM. This affected me on a spiritual level, because I knew that she was a bitchy rich girl from the suburbs who already had a white Jeep despite being fourteen, but I also knew immediately that what this girl was doing was CUNT. Like I was so taken aback by the amount of time this look must have taken in the morning that I was starting to consider it performance art. As freshman year continued I was gagged by her looks daily, her full mint green lululemon set blinded me, she would pull from her endless supply of tennis skirts at least twice a week.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Soon I learned Lauren had a best friend named Lexi, who also would never leave the house without at LEAST ten layers of mascara. She was great because at one point she worked for a Herbalife smoothie bowl place where all of the smoothies weren't made with real fruit, they were made with Herbalife powder. I once watched her take five minutes to cut up one banana. Lexi also, during deep covid, made a series of Tik Toks where she pretended to have lost her arm in a shark attack.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With the advent of the Addison Raenaissance I have come to realize that all of this lore I have on Lauren and Lexi is incredibly Addison Rae coded. Addison went from doing the renegade (was that her or charli? Does it matter?) in Texas to giggling on stage with Arca in Berlin, and this is now a future I see for Lauren and Lexi. Their COMMITMENT to serving maximalist bitch cunt was undeniable and if they could get a little bit more nonbinary, boom instant DJ career. Before freshman year homecoming Lauren didn’t come to school for three days because her spray tan was so strong she couldn’t be seen in public before it baked into her skin for a few days. And then she wore an orange dress that practically blended in with her skin. Lauren could do Diet Pepsi but I DON’T think Addison can pull off that maneuver. If we can just get them at the Met Gala, and also make the theme camp again, I guarantee that something huge would happen.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">We NEED to start cuntifying the bitchy girls from highschool and making them into Paris Hilton level gay icons.

        "description": "Have you ever looked at a man? And I mean really looked at him. Past all the greasy hair, the dirty skin, the general repulsiveness, and thought: Huh. He would make a GREAT girl.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">I’ve said a lot of words about the athletes in the National Hockey League in the past. Some of these opinions have been met with more backlash than others, but I believe my critics are simply afraid of the truths I speak. Here are my qualifications: I have been an out and proud bandwagon fan of the Colorado Avalanche since April of 2021–that is to say, the burgundy and blue runs in my blood. I am a dedicated BU hockey devotee, earning a free Men’s Under Armour Red Boston University Terriers Hockey Jersey (retail value $117.00) and over 20 singular tacos from El Jefe’s. I spent a brief stint on the NHL Youth Advisory Board, arguing with old men about pride jerseys and Fortnite skins. Also, I’m a lesbian, which automatically makes me more correct than everyone else.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">With that established, here is a list of real, actual things I’ve said to my friends about professional male hockey players in the NHL.</p><p>‍</p><ol id=\"\"><li>Estrogen could’ve saved her.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I know–it’s in the title of the article, but for good reason. Have you ever looked at a man? And I mean <em id=\"\">really</em> looked at him. Past all the greasy hair, the dirty skin, the general repulsiveness, and thought: <em id=\"\">Huh. He would make a GREAT girl</em>. I don’t expect all of you to understand me. In fact, a very small subsect of you will get it, but for the non-believers, I just ask that you walk with me here. First, hockey players are obsessed with their hair. The flow, the lettuce, whatever you want to call it. Just watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForeverMightyFM/status/1364032214346956801\">this GIF</a> of former Anaheim Ducks players Max Jones and Maxime Comtois “recognizing the flow” of Trevor Zegras. Estrogen actually binds to receptors on hair follicles and boosts the growth phase, meaning players, once on estrogen, will find themselves with thicker, shinier, <em id=\"\">better</em> hair, instantly raising their social status and improving their aerodynamics on the ice. Second, the fat redistribution caused by estrogen could be <em id=\"\">advantageous</em> to players. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GornRqDMS_g?si=0ryBna0foujVOnY8&t=123\" id=\"\">Checking</a>–using the body to knock an opponent in possession of the puck into the ice or against the boards–is an important part of defensive strategy. Increased body fat in the chest, hips, and thighs could lower players’ center of gravity and help them bounce off of the boards and others, enabling quicker recovery and better offense.</p><p>‍</p><ol start=\"2\" id=\"\"><li>They NEED to fuck.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I mean, come on. Anyone with eyes could see this. Players constantly rough each other up, get up into each other’s faces, slam each other into the boards–hell, they even drop their thick, protective gloves to fight each other. Why would you risk bloody, split knuckles, knocked-out teeth, black eyes, broken noses, just for a brief moment of reprieve? I’ll tell you why: skin-to-skin contact is necessary to alleviate the thick, palpable sexual tension that builds throughout every single game. The rough, physical nature of men’s hockey, the aggressive posturing that occurs after every whistle, are all simply proxies for the heat of raw <em id=\"\">want</em>. You’ll never see a player skating to the penalty box after an altercation with anything but a feral smile on his face, the ecstasy of adrenaline fresh in his veins. Writing about the intersection of violence with physical desire, Richard Siken once said, “Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.” What else is there to say?</p><p>‍</p><ol start=\"3\" id=\"\"><li>A BDSM relationship would fix him.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">To the uninitiated, this may seem absurd. However, hockey players are notorious for being superstitious and ritualistic to the point of absurdity. Waking up at the exact same time on game days, eating the same meals, napping for the same timespan, putting gear on in a specific order, tapping doorways in the arena a certain amount of times, the list goes on. Sidney Crosby, one of the best hockey players of all time, has been wearing the exact same jockstrap every single game since 2005. These athletes desperately claw for ways to feel in control of their game, and what better way than to remove control entirely? That way, players don’t need to spend countless hours worrying about routines and superstitions–they can devote all their focus to playing the best they can. Also, these guys LOVE constructing intricate rituals:</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/659444782072da89d2270aab/673757dcf42ce92f0c76e586_AD_4nXe0lNI0VE1VNSO0l5Jv8DUnrpM0bDtf3kpJEF3bVHLX6xIL5ntI6yzC7QJ9VDKizYAzwtUoET54fX7SWjTe0aevTJgZc0YaiD9YzyT9Xa2FmaXpop5Rpc9zsgpXRZ3BzrHrPYPOcg.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">And these rituals?

Get them some whips and chains, stat! And last, but certainly not least, Pekka Rinne putting an actual, literal DOG COLLAR on Juuse Saros to congratulate him for a game well played (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PredsNHL/status/1110393615426244608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1110393615426244608%7Ctwgr%5E98f0314715b06dbbc0355f20860b234ea10674b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontheforecheck.com%2Ffive-hole-friday-ferda-nashville-predators%2F\" id=\"\">0:54–0:59</a>).

        "content": "<p id=\"\">There is an epidemic on this campus. And that epidemic is bisexual twinks. They are walking around this campus with slutty waists, cunty outfits, and an unmatched audacity. &nbsp;They’re manipulating men and women alike. Someone must take care of them or they will run the city of Boston. As a (pretty much) lesbian, this role often falls to me. A twink handler, one could say. However, as the semester moves forward I have become overworked, underpaid, and overbooked!</p><p id=\"\">This year Boston University gave me a brownstone room with a decent sized basement. While this may seem like simple luck, it was actually part of the stipend for my UROP project: locking as many bisexual twinks in that basement as damn near possible. Part research, part community aid I set up my new enclosure with all the necessary supplies: baggy pants (à la Troye Sivan), dangly earrings, a record player <em id=\"\">and</em> cassette player &nbsp;(Alex G, Hole, Omar Apollo, and Patti Smith queued on a loop), a thousand fidget toys, Hot Cheetos, and a singular Yerba Mate. I captured my subjects sunning around campus with a very very large net, scooping them up every time I saw a walk too sassy or a baby tee too perfectly cropped. </p><p id=\"\">Once safely in my basement enclosure, the bisexual twinks settled in quite comfortably, each finding a corner to brood in while eyeing the Yerba Mate and critiquing each other’s thrifting choices. I had even added a little ‘sulking station’ under a strategically placed patch of moody string lights (complete with all the oversized hoodies and blankets they’d need to feel safely enveloped) which quickly became the most popular corner. However, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Almost immediately, they began organizing a rebellion, communicating in half-baked TikTok quotes and hushed whispers. I noticed that with each week, managing the twinks required more of my energy. Every day, I fielded demands for new fidget toys, warm light fixtures, and never ending American Spirits. They girl-bossed and they gaslite me into thinking perhaps I made a mistake – perhaps I could not create them a new home. </p><p id=\"\">But just when I thought the twinks had broken me down, a strange shift occurred. One of the more assertive twinks (the better of smudged eyeliner) stood up during a rebellion planning session and declared, “What if we just… like… <em id=\"\">thrive</em> in here?”</p><p id=\"\">The twink coalition found a new sense of purpose. They pooled their resources and divided up responsibilities with surprising efficiency. The artsier twinks became interior designers curating a vibrant living space that could rival any Brooklyn pop-up gallery. The philosophers and poets organized nightly ‘salons’ in the sulking station, where they took turns reading overly earnest zines and pondering the existential questions raised in both male manipulatory music and queer coded films. They even crafted a constitution, declaring the basement a sovereign nation known as Twinktopia.</p><p id=\"\">Twinktopia became a self-sustaining ecosystem. They even set up a barter system, where talents and resources were exchanged for hand-rolled cigarettes, vintage accessories, or homemade kombucha. Some started learning practical skills – little bi boys who had once never held a power drill suddenly began constructing loft beds and floating bookshelves from salvaged wood, carving an artisan paradise in the heart of the basement. As for me?</p><p id=\"\">No longer was I an overburdened twink wrangler; I have ascended (read: been promoted to) benevolent overseer, an ethereal monarch, a passive queer dictator. I realized they didn’t need containment, they needed a space to create glittering, grunge-worn utopia.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">There are many mixed emotions as I go into my last semester of undergrad this Spring. I think about all I’ve accomplished, all the friends I’ve made, and all the challenges I’ve faced. And of course, it also makes me think about my post-college plans. Right now, it’s been 100% graduate school. But there are always other options. </p><p id=\"\">According to tiktok.gov, I heard topless maids make a lot of money, so I tried to practice a few weeks ago without an audience. Just my free labor. I was inspired by the women I saw on tiktok giving a rundown of their day in the life as topless maids and explaining how much money these lonely men give them. </p><p id=\"\">Our apartment bathroom needed some cleaning, and if I was gonna get down and dirty, it obviously made the most sense to do it with my clothes off. The main reason I found myself topless and cleaning my bathroom was to avoid getting my clothes dirty and then having to do more laundry. Tits out saves on the water bill. So not only am I cleaning the apartment, I am reversing climate change. I have three roommates and unfortunately for them, they did not get to witness. I understand the hard work it takes to clean topless let alone with an audience. </p><p id=\"\">And off I went. I scrubbed that countertop, getting in all the right spots and making sure that sink would spray and drain when I finished. I was on my knees until they were bruised, &nbsp;scrubbing our dirty grimy floor. And you bet at some points I was on all fours. I disinfected the toilet so people (me) can recreate their favorite chair dance when they’re taking their coffee shits. </p><p id=\"\">And voila, our bathroom was brand-assclapping-new. Topless maids really show how people with knockers can do anything, but they do it even better with their nips almost touching the toilet bowl.

UFO sightings and bigfoot are all good and creepy to hear about but recently I’ve been experiencing a supernatural mystery myself. Everytime I wait at a BU bus (Boob Bus) station I have to wait for the bus that will take me back to my home, the beautiful oasis that is the Fenway campus. I knew that living there would mean that I would have to start getting my steps in, but I was always promised the reprieve of the “Fenway Bus” in times of need.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">According to the BU transit app the Fenway bus runs regularly, but according to my eyeballs the bus is only spotted once in a blue moon. No matter what stop I wait at, it’s always the same, I open mouth stare at the wait time until it says NOW and then I look up and there is no bus to be seen. Sometimes I swear I can smell the faint scent of B.O. that’s been absorbed into the bowling alley ass fabric that lines the Boob Bus seats, but no matter how hard I stare at either sides of the street no bus appears.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The trouble then becomes that the next bus scheduled is somehow always scheduled for 7:36am the next morning. All of the Fenway busses seem to have disappeared out of thin air, EXCEPT when I’m walking down Beacon street. It’s always as soon as I exit Shippy’s (I’m there to buy buzzballs, to drink away the pain the Fenway Bus causes me) that I see the Fenway bus whiz past me filled to the brink with maximum two people. Where did you come from, where did you go?&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This is a case that doesn’t sit right with me. When Malaysian flight 370 disappeared in 2014 it inspired the most expensive search for a missing aircraft, so Boston University, where is the search for the missing Fenway busses?</p><p>‍</p>",

I am quite excited, having been a stan since WAY before they disgraced Ethel’s memory by including Strangers in the It Ends With Us trailer. I refuse to watch that horrific film not only because it’s written by that wretched woman Colleen Hoover, but they ALSO tarnished the song where Ethel’s ghost sings about getting murdered and cannibalized by a man she thought loved her!! What the fuck!!! I’d rather be murdered and cannibalized than read a Colleen Hoover book and they went and disrespected Strangers like that. Anyway, I need to calm down. I can’t wait for Punish to drop! Surely its lyrics won’t worm their way into my brain, soul, and ever-beating heart! Surely it won’t lead me to reflect on my relationship with the world, the people in it, and being raised Catholic!&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">[POST- PUNISH RELEASE]</p><p id=\"\">I AM PUNISHED BY LOVE. This song has been out for less than two weeks now and I fear it has already made it into my top streamed songs of the year because I’ve looped it Hella. I want to fuck the guitar distortion, caress the lyrics, and french kiss the piano. There’s no fuck marry kill around here. I couldn’t kill anything. I just need to lick the sound of the swingset in the intro and dry hump the ambient background. Ethel has the voice of an angel – one I’d build cathedrals and write hymns for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">The tracklist dropped with song runtimes yesterday, and it is the shortest song on the album at six minutes and forty seconds with the longest song being over FIFTEEN MINUTES LONG!!! Golly, I’m going to perv out so hard when this drops! I respect her devotion to getting rid of the “fans” who can’t take her music seriously that she discussed on tumblr (which I fully agree with when your art covers subject matter as dark as hers) because I fear a lot of them won’t have the attention spans for this album. But me? Not I, says the dog.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I have made the pilgrimage to the front row at her concert, and I have been baptized with the touch of her hand on mine. I have had the bridge of Thoroughfare (favorite part of my favorite song) sung to me with direct eye contact and there’s no going back. Lock me up at this point. I’m about to get perverted in a way that has never been seen before.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p>",

Take a break. Take a breath. Look deep inside. And consider this: why? What could <em id=\"\">possibly</em> be prompting this sort of behavior? What sort of inadequacy are you trying to overcompensate for with your need to constantly make your presence known? All eyes should in fact NOT be on you in the center of the ring just like a circus.

Years of reading feminist literature at coffee shops and wearing tote bags. But do not worry gents, we’ve finally made a large, dare I say, gargantuan step in the fight for progress. Doesn’t it feel that after going to women’s rights marches, crossing the street to avoid walking behind a woman, or getting upset over the price of feminine hygiene products (it should be free 😔), it's about time we got some representation in the Pinky Toe?&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">But we must not stop dreaming, straight cis reader. We must continue to unite and make sure our voices are heard (not over women though). We are needed in this battle against the terrible, horrible patriarchy. We need more straight men to tell everyone not to take space from women! If we don’t, who will? Who’s gonna tell periods to stop it when they hurt? Or explain sports in a “non-condescending” way? I say to you, my faithful feminist straight he/hims reading this, put on those thrifted double-knee Carhartts, put on some of your favorite tunes like Laufey or Clairo (it's ok, you can admit you like them), and step out with hope in your heart. Hope that times are finally changing, hope that you will be represented, and that we too can finally change the narrative that nice guys finish last.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I also have a message for the women and non-binary readers. I, a straight men, recognize that I occupy the space inhabited and cared for by women, non-binary, and non-heterosexual men on behalf of us straights. I acknowledge and see the impact this has on others in society, and I stand on the shoulders of hilarious marginalized people, and hope that we can prove straight guys can do satire too. I acknowledge the healing necessary from men claiming they can play guitar or the Cuh Dey Board guy on Tik Tok. This acknowledgment comes with a commitment to arguing with other men about abortion, not using our women and LGBTQ friends to claim we’re not problematic, and to not mansplain (unless we know we’re right but it's not because we think you’re less intelligent).</p><p>‍</p>",

You can look dykey in a crop top. I promise it will be ok.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">Perhaps I imagine that she’s more tapped into my culture than she really is.

She is just beautiful, some may argue too pretty to be a politician. Seriously, when was the last time you saw a politician so scrumptious? She is also super accessible: she went to BU. I’m sure if I wander around long enough in the international relations department I’ll bump right into her. Fun fact: Did you know she lived in warren towers? I could be sleeping in the same bed she went to pound town on. God damn, I have a lady boner.&nbsp;</li><li>JD Vance. I know I know, he isn’t a biological female (to my knowledge). But I think his dick is so small it might as well be a clit. Therefore, I think it is fair to say that I could potentially eat him out. My whole life I have been attracted to male manipulators like Vance. Maybe it’s my daddy issues or something… regardless, I would let him tell me what to do since I so crave his useless validation. Have you seen the way he makes up stories? You know I love when men lie to me, that’s why I stayed with my ex so long.&nbsp;</li><li>Recently I have been looking for a more fit partner which is why I am turning towards Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is spunky, powerful, and most importantly unhinged. I will never know her next move and that is so very exciting in the bedroom. Speaking of her immense power, have you seen her workout routine? She lifts more than I weigh!!! She may just be the perfect dommy mommy for my oral escapades.&nbsp;</li><li>In light of the next campaign, I must highlight my personal vote, Kamala Harris. Her vibrant energy is contagious and draws me to her like a moth to a flame. Do you think she laughs when she cums? Do you think I will start laughing like her after we share this intimate experience? I hope so. Her signature laugh turns me on everytime I hear it. I can only imagine how powerful I would become if I could laugh like her. Not only would we have amazing physical chemistry, but our political ideas align, which is really important for a healthy sexual relationship.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">You heard it here first; these are my top 4 picks to eat out. Please don’t contact me about my crazed opinions, just take it to the polls.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p>",

        "description": "A modern retelling of a classic love tale. ",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Once upon a time in the twilight dusk, a kind, beautiful, sexy, gorgina, girl, named Cindierella, not unlike myself one could say, had 2 evil study group members in her intro coding class. Every day during DS100 they would laugh and say “hahaha you dont know how to code you little dumdum you”. And they were right, there had never been a person in the history of the FTU (FairyTale Universe of course) that was more booty cheeks ass at coding. But the prophecy bestowed by her google calendar decreed that her quest would not only include going to class, but also, heaven forbid, taking notes. Alas she was the chosen one and must therefore obey O Gcal’s call to adventure every tuesday and thursday.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Every night when Cindie would do her homework, she would sing a trending tiktok sound out the window and the rats and squirrels of comm ave would scritter into her room and they would sing and dance and do her coding homework for her! Her roomates hated her, the rats would shit all over the room and the squirrels would steal any edikted top they could find buried in the drawers. But never princess polly, they were particular about that.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">One fateful tuesday the upcoming midterm was announced and Cindierella cried and cried because how was she going to sneak a rat into questrom! Ugh and a squirrel would be even worse, she’d have to tell everyone she got hair extensions, or perhaps that minx scarves are back in this year? When all of a sudden in a puff of smoke Fairy GodTerrier appeared in the dorm! But dont get the wrong idea, not like a real dog enlarged, instead stood a very tall man in the rhett costume, topped with a fluffy dress, cape, and a comically large magic wand embellished with a bedazzled star.</p><p id=\"\">“Cindierella I have come to grant a brief switcheroo of The Zuck’s coding abilities and your ability to knit really fucking fast. From now until 6pm you will be a python whiz and Zuck will spend some quality time making his family some meaningful christmas gifts.”&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Cinderella hip hip hoorayed and headed to the computer to test it out, and before she even knew what her hands were doing she had typed:</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">“result = {\"original_list\": input_list, \"filtered_sum\": sum(map(lambda x: x if x &lt;= threshold else 0, filter(lambda y: y &lt;= threshold, map(lambda n: (lambda f, m: f(f, m))(lambda f, m: m if m &lt;= 1 else m * f(f, m-1), n), input_list))))}”</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">She had no idea what that did but the cell ran perfectly so she hip hip hoorayed yet again. God her roomates hated her.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Cindie wore her best indie outfit on the day of the royal midterm, ready to dress to impress her evil study group partners and dared ascend the steps of questrom for her 4:45 data science lecture. As she stepped up each stair she began to notice a sinister, evil sound… flip, flop, flip, flop. She looked down at her shoe, better known on depop as vintage thrifted y2k office-siren painted leather doc marten loafers, and realized the sole was slowly peeling off and flapping and clapping in the wind with each step. Cindie rushed inside and prayed and prayed it wouldnt fall off in front of the dwarves smoking their hooked pipes outside the questrom doors, lest they trap her in a riddle. Cindie began the midterm but even with her new magical talents it was slow going typing all this shit out. Before she knew it, it was 6pm and she hadnt finished so she wiped her hands on the keyboard and hoped that some successful code was buried in that keyboard smash and ran out of the lecture hall before anyone noticed she was a cheating coding genius.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Yet on the way down, the unthinkable happened. The sole of her docs fell off right in front of a girl in a designer suit and before she could hurl her goyard bag at Cindie for being a poor, stupid, poor person, Cindie ran down the steps leaving the poor old sole behind.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Back safely at home she hoped that one day a beautiful and rich questrom girl in the process of discovering her queer identity would find her sole, subsequently find Cindie and of course share true love’s first kiss in front of the security guard. But alas, here I am still waiting for my Princess Charming…</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

With this in mind, I knew a crossroad would eventually find me.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I moved into my new apartment off campus, hope filling my heart and spirit — but I would soon learn the true weight of my foolishness.

The object spun endlessly, yet ineffectively.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">Peering closer I noticed a loosened screw. Before I could ponder my situation any longer a thought struck me.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">No, like seriously…&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">So basically, the show takes place in a world where the Earth exists in the same universe as a race of magical aliens with gems at the center of their bodies which are just manifestations of light. The gem race comes from a place called Homeworld, and they’re led by the Diamond Authority which consists of three tall ass cunty bad bitches (one of them is literally voiced by Patti Lupone) and one little runt named Pink Diamond. Now the Diamonds use the resources on their planet to create more gems to be their followers and fulfill specific duties and they go around colonizing other planets to use their resources to make more gems. The story arch of the show itself begins when the Diamonds try to conquer Earth.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tPink Diamond was like the baby of the Diamonds and didn’t have any colonies that she was in charge of so like the whiny bitch she was, she literally begged to have her own colony. The other three Diamonds gave her Earth, but she literally got bored right away cause it wasn’t as interesting as she thought it was gonna be.</p><p id=\"\">\t</p><p id=\"\">\tDuring the time that she was commanding the colony, one of her Rose Quartz soldiers goes rogue because she just loves all of the organic life forms on Earth and starts a rebellion to try and win Earth’s freedom. She rallies a bunch of rebel gems together calling themselves the Crystal Gems and they fight for like a couple thousand years and eventually Rose Quartz SHATTERS Pink Diamond (which basically is like the only way to kill these immortal beings). The rebellion ends up winning the war, but the other three Diamonds get really mad cause their sister/kid (idk) Pink Diamond is dead and unleash the ultimate attack on earth which takes out literally every gem on earth except Rose Quartz and the three other gems she can hide behind her shield.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tRose Quartz and her besties, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl all live on Earth for another couple of thousand years and eventually Rose falls in love with this human named Greg Universe. Props to Greg for bagging an 8ft tall pink haired curvy alien diva. Rose then decides that she wants to like have a kid with Greg even though that's unheard of and makes our main character, the half gem half human Steven Universe (roll credits, jk, I’m nowhere near done) and as a result gives up her physical form. RIP.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tSo the show starts following Steven who’s kind of in uncharted territory because he’s the first ever gem human hybrid. We follow along on his journey as he learns to control the powers that he inherited from his mother, like her shield and healing powers. On his journey he is mentored by the remaining three Crystal Gems Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl who all love him but are also kinda sad that baddie b Rose Quartz is gone. Steven meets a pink lion that was somehow connected to his mom which also has a whole dimension in his mane where Rose Quartz kept secrets. The Diamonds are also still pissed at Rose Quartz so the Crystal Gems have to thwart a few plans to destroy the Earth and make some new friends along the way. Then in search of answers, Steven goes to the place where his mom shattered Pink Diamond and what do you know, Blue Diamond is there and abducts his dad. The Crystal Gems have to go into space to save Greg and this really pisses off the Diamonds and then they send two gems to abduct a bunch of humans that Steven mentioned in a previous episode. Steven being the selfless main character he is, turns himself in for his friends’ freedom. Also one of his human friends, Lars,&nbsp; hid on the abduction ship and still got captured like a loser.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tSteven gets taken to space and put on trial as Rose Quartz for killing Pink Diamond and his lawyer is like “yo this doesn’t make sense, how could Rose Quartz have even killed Pink Diamond? Why wasn’t anyone protecting her” and Steven is all like “Wait a minute, he’s got a point.” But this just makes the Diamonds angry so Steven takes Lars and manages to escape into the deep caves of Homeworld. They meet some other rebel gems who the Diamonds want dead and Lars dies protecting them, but Steven brings him back to life with his tears and Lars turns purple and gets magic hair that connects to the same dimension as lion’s mane and Steven uses it to go home. Then they lowkey act like everything is normal as if Steven wasn’t just abducted into the far recesses of space. Steven learns from Pearl, Rose’s sworn secret keeper and attendant that ROSE QUARTZ WAS ACTUALLY PINK DIAMOND AND FAKED HER OWN DEATH. Crazy right? I know.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tAfter this, Yellow and Blue Diamond come to Earth to fuck shit up but Steven is like, “Wait, I’m literally Pink Diamond.” And Yellow and Blue are like “Slay, you’re not dead” and they all go back to Homeworld together.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tThen there’s kinda drama because the Diamonds aren't actually fully happy with Steven being Pink Diamond so they throw him in jail for a bit and all of them beef. The White Diamond pulls Steven’s gem out of his stomach cause she wants the regular Pink Diamond back but it doesn’t work and the gem just turns into a Pink Steven that refuses with him. Then they decide to love him like he’s the real Pink Diamond and then happily ever after.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">\tThere’s like a whole movie and another sequel show after that but I’ll spare you the details of that. Anyway…what were we doing?</p><p>‍</p>",

The traitor and freak that I once called my best friend lights up and she immediately begins asking my mom about which fairy slut so far has been her favorite. </p><p id=\"\">Rats!

I don’t believe in slut shaming in 2024 the year of our savior </p><p id=\"\">Little did I know where my forced approval of all fairy humping would lead. The next week my mom mailed me and my friend the entire box set of ACOTAR to read alongside her.

I could even stand my friends quoting phrases like “nipples hard like pebbles” with her during every school visit. The straw that finally broke the camel’s back, however, was when I found out my mom was not only brainwashing my community, but has been advertising the ACOTAR series to all the teachers she works with! They were talking fairy dick at the damn staff meeting!</p><p id=\"\">It must stop! I can not idly stand by while the entirety of my hometown educators are too busy talking about wing sensitivity to teach! I have created the reality Ron Desantis fears!? </p><p id=\"\">I must start banning books in my own household. Like any good vigilante I did the only logical step and while I was home this past summer, and started whispering republican conspiracy theories into my moms phone. I knew it worked when she started sending me those AI generated photos of Jesus you can find on facebook. I am happy to report that conversion therapy via republican indoctrination works and my mother is now free from the shackles of the Siren Song of Sarah J Maas and all smut writers alike.</p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">Wait… what’s Crescent City? </em></p><p id=\"\">Duty calls: the fairies have turned into fairy frat bros that smoke fairy weed and let women sit on their faces.

My friend Olga Syphil, having “Among Us thumbs,” and unfortunately, also having a fucked up immune system that cannot properly digest gluten. Now, what is gluten you may ask? Well, gluten is a protein that is found in things like barley, rye, and wheat (to name a few). While this condition, known as Celiac Disease, has become more well known over time, we are still an underrepresented minority in a world where tyrannical immunotypical bigots reign supreme. So, I’d like to pose you a question. You hear about homophobic celebrities all the time - what about celiphobic celebrities?

        "description": "The West Campus Raising Cane's is usually a hotspot for students, but on this particular Saturday, something felt off. I walked into a sea of Boston College fans, instantly feeling outnumbered and out of place as they swarmed the restaurant like they'd never seen a chicken tender before.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">The West Campus Raisin Canes is a wonderful addition to the Boston University campus. So much so that it attracts students from all universities across Boston<em id=\"\">. </em>However, one school NOT in Boston is also a fan of the establishment at 949 Commonwealth Ave. And when they come, they come in pacts. It was a Saturday night, and I needed to fill my belly up before going on a bar crawl. I did not want to do dishes or cook, so placed my pickup order as I always do on Grubhub to get my 3 finger combo with an extra Texas toast and a diet Pepsi (thank you Addison Rae). </p><p id=\"\">But as I walked into Canes, something felt wrong in the air . Now, Canes is usually crowded on weekends as expected, but something was different this time. First I thought I was surrounded by a bunch of high schoolers, but as I got a closer look, I noticed the dark red and gold lettering that people were wearing and I realized: I’m surrounded. I had never seen so many white people in one place on campus. I was just trying to pick up my Cane's order because getting drunk on an empty stomach is a no-go. So you could expect my confusion when I walk in and I see a bunch of Eagles trying to gentrify the Caniac combo. I was worried they thought Nick Fuentes was still a student at BU and they were here for a meet and greet. </p><p id=\"\">To make matters worse, amidst the chaos erupting, someone dropped their drink on my shoe which was when I realized I got hate crimed. As a non white BU student who survived the trenches of a PWI high school, this wasn’t my first January 6th. It felt like So High School by Taylor Swift except instead of stifling my sighs, I had to stifle my childhood trauma.</p><p id=\"\">I just wanted my Texas toast without feeling like I was in the actual red state. The main question I had throughout this endeavor was why they went all the way out to actual Boston just to get Canes. It would take around 30 minutes on the T to get there from their campus. It was the fan behavior for me. </p><p id=\"\"> I can safely say I survived but barely. So to protect yourself and your fellow POCs for the future, don’t go to the BU Raisin Canes the day of a BC football game. I’d recommend putting in your Google Calendar when their football games are so you can protect yourself and save up some money to pay for delivery instead. The only thing we can do is make sure they don’t come for El Jefe’s next. </p><p>‍</p>",

The initial hopeful feeling when I came back, the two weeks of non-stop tinder and hinge swiping; which leads to about 5 short talking stages that lead nowhere, a few matches that never respond to your first message, and at least ten that you never start talking to in the first place.

My friends keep telling me “It’s not that bad” and “She only has to stick one thing up there” among other things, as if that’s supposed to be some sort of calming reassurance for me.

I can feel the sweat building up all over my body. Gynecologists have always scared me. What if I don’t perform well? What if the medical equipment surrounding us is a huge turn-off?

What if I’m no good and he gets pissed at me?</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">On the day of the appointment, I woke up startled. Everything leaves me feeling unsteady on my feet.

I understand that most vaginas have to be seen by a gynecologist at least once in their lifetime, and I can’t be the first to refuse “the full treatment.”</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">I walk in with my head held high.

Now that I have sufficiently humiliated myself, I have a lot less questions and fears.

In such a notorious city it’s no wonder that all the best artists manage to make their way here.

I’ve got six concerts on deck and you won't catch me letting that number fall to zero if I can help it. Life is short and though I’d like it to be shorter, then I wouldn’t be able to go to as many concerts.

And if I’m gonna go I might as well buy the $300 dollar tickets to be at the barricade right?

So imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning to see two emails from my ex sent to my BU email address with an identical subject line “KINES262 Bone List One (2).pptx”. Bone list????? Is this like a list of people he wishes to bone to get over me?? Makes sense. I was the greatest thing he ever had. &nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">\tI of course had to open the emails. Both of them had powerpoint attachments; one email had no accompanying text while the other said “the thing” and nothing else. I’m sorry, but I don’t ever recall discussing this thing. I should also mention that I was the only recipient of these two emails. </p><p id=\"\">\tNext, I opened the powerpoint attachments. It was just a powerpoint of bones…like literal bones…and not the sexy kind. I mean the ones that keep us from turning into jello. Is this a sign he wants to murder me or something? I mean I get it. I would wanna murder my ex if they devastatingly broke my heart after I gave them less than the bare minimum. It’s funny. He sends me a bone list, yet he is the last person I would ever want to bone. </p><p id=\"\">\tMy ex studies kinesiology, so I guess it makes sense he is studying bones. But why would he send his class slides to me? How the fuck does one accidentally send an email to the wrong person TWICE? I knew he was a bonehead, but I still have yet to figure out how this happened after pondering long and hard about my unfortunate previous life choices to date this man. Thinking about it sends shivers down my spine. He could easily find his patella even when it became hella dislocated that one time we went ice skating together, but he could never find the clit in the three and a half years we were together. </p><p id=\"\">\tThere are 206 bones in the human body. But not a single bone in my body has any desire to be with him. It appears I still have a strong hold on him, just like the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The stapes, which is the smallest bone, perfectly represents the effort he gave me. I really thought I could fix him, just like doctors can fix broken bones. But I couldn’t. Good luck with your bone exam. You’re gonna need it, since it must be hard to study when you keep thinking about me. Makes sense though, since you must be having a hard time finding a girl who would ever be willing to bone you. &nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"center\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/659444782072da89d2270aab/6632205f8c15c7c58df62091_IJlj7U-Pih4IWD283gPZ8DJcCc83VjOXyfcWrgsBwA6n4FPMOSEIMrHHZsvpJakgN8XfBdaJF9ZysSqPLH2RKY0AorV86h6OUx0RGrptB9DKHwBgwM-L9ay_7mG9L530KMbb6_zujqXeHk_Nwbxr76o.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"\" loading=\"auto\" id=\"\"></div></figure><p>‍</p>",

        "content": "Hey what’s up you guys! *enthusiastic influencer gesturing* Over the last few weeks we’ve had a depressing election, a  second wave of midterms, and I lost my airpods, so you could say I’ve been feeling low. So I decided it was time for a little self-care day. Mental. Health. Matters. For men too. But they’re getting a lot of publicity about that recently so lets hold space for me instead.\n\n I thought about a spa day or a nice massage but then it came to me. What could be more relaxing than a bubbly, dill-infused fermentation period!\n\nInstructions on this recipe say to begin with a nice mason jar that’s clear enough to check on your progress. This week I’ll be using the BUild lab as my container of choice! It’s transparent and clearly labeled so i wont get lost in the fridge.\n\nNext, I’ll be using a brining liquid of 1 part water, 1 part vinegar, blah blah blah fuck this recipe why are you telling me what to do?? Today I’ll be adding 400 literes of Charles River water, however much salt is on the sidewalks, and battery acid from all the smoke detectors across campus because I like a pickle with a real sour bite. And of course some fresh dill!\n\nAs I slip into the green, cold, somewhat chunky (I think the batteries were expired) I feel an instant wave of relaxation wash over me. I can feel healing properties of mercury seeping into me, the gut-biome-fluencer on wellness-tok was telling me all about them. I sink to the bottom and feel the dill tickle my toes and the soothing salt exfoliation begin eroding my bunions away.\n\nYes. I’m sure. This is exactly what I needed. I feel better already. I paddle through the chartreuse colored waves and seal the lab up. Air would hinder the fermentation process and make me a floppy, acrid, spoiled mess.\n\nOnce I get bubbly and the green seeps into my skin enough to make me sour yet refreshingly sharp and witty, take me out and enjoy on a nice juicy burger, gluten free tuna melt, fruit roll up with chamoy, or just maybe a sunny Boston day.\n",

        "content": "In my life there are a handful of questions I’ve been stopped and asked about more than I’ve ever been asked out by a beautiful woman, so let me get those out of the way. \n\nNo, I don’t want to join your Bible study. \n\nYes, I’m aware that my collection of cardigans reminds you of your 10th grade English teacher. \n\nAnd yeah, I can recite the entirety of Justin’s Believe album, start to finish.\n\nEach fleeting moment I spy a gorgeously gay gay walking past me, I hold my breath, because surely she can tell that I sleep below movie posters of A League of Their Own and Thelma and Louise. But alas, no up and down glances, no immediate make out sessions, no chaining me down with carabiners. I’m passed by. \n\nI don’t want to say it’s my own fault that I’ve built up a brand on par with a mildly tempered southern woman, but I suppose it might be. Except this is simply who I am today, if I want answers, I need to dive deeper. What choice did I make in the past that bundled up this bursting rainbow?\n\nI decided to seek out answers, and as fate would have it, Comm Ave’s straight campus led me to them. Instead of being shoved meeting minutes from the LDS chapter on the street, I was shoved a card for professional help: Paul’s Fortune Telling. \n\nLate one evening, I crawled down to visit the mysterious fortune teller on Comm Ave, who everyone else similarly seemed to pass by during the day. He would understand me. With a reasonable donation of $30 USD, Paul was ready to read my palm. \n\n“Ah yes, just as I suspected, curved lines in every which way until one moment and they all became straight,” he pointed to the center of my hand. “You must have squandered something.” I looked down and traced my own finger across what he referred to. Oh god. How could I have never noticed?\n\n“Most of my clients who come to me with these hands attribute their passing qualities to the Second Industrial Revolution, with a cardigan just like that one.” He pointed to my outfit. What? This has to do with the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory?\n\n“It seems as though all domestic traits became permanently sealed inside your soul once the disaster occurred, explaining your current outward appearance today,” detailed the all knowing oracle. \n\n“But I can trace your lack of straightness to the fact that you were sewing a garment of blues and pinks and purples. How scandalous! Most people have a hard time spotting the early gays because all of the images from that time are grayscale.”\n\nIt all made sense now. My soul is closeted inside the 1911 industrial worker version of me.\n\n“Of course, I can recommend listening to Simon de Beauvoir on tape or carrying around a Rosie the Riveter pin, but those largely yield disappointing or pretentious results. I’m afraid you may have to persevere through this condition for the rest of your life.”\n\nAnd so I have. I will carry on the historic shield glued to my face.\n\nBut if you’ve made it this far, and you're into girls, and you see me doing Luda’s verse during Bieber karaoke, just know that those words could all be about you baby ;)\n\n",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">Recently, I created a list stacked to the brim of diva gay icons for me to listen to. Paula Abdul, Madonna, Diana Ross, and of course, the icon and legend, Janet Jackson. I started with <em id=\"\">Control</em>. A fine album indeed. A great start. I then moved on to <em id=\"\">Rhythm Nation 1814</em>. Wow. Blown away. Insane. I thought for sure that I had reached peak gayness. And then I listened to <em id=\"\">janet. (Deluxe Edition)</em>. Hoooolyyy cow. Who had been hiding this gem from me? It was amazing. But let’s not get ahead of myself. Let me explain a few other things.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">My love for Trader Joe’s started at a very young age. I met my best friend Olga Syphil in the second grade (yes, she’s still my best friend even though she planted three hemorrhoids in my anal cavity and five tucked away behind my uvula). We bonded over our love for sugar and her love of cannibalism. However, perhaps the most exciting part of being her friend was the fact that her dad worked at Trader Joe’s. Each time we went to Trader Joe’s we would look to see if he was working that day, and if he was, he would give me a little lollipop. Truly the best thing you could ever receive as an elementary schooler. And thus, I began to connect Trader Joe’s with sweetness and Olga (and Olga with the fresh scent of a roasted human body, seasoned to perfection with the Trader Joe’s Mushroom &amp; Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend!).</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">My love for serving face, however, started quite recently. (If you must know, the longer I’ve been single, the more my hate and anger has increased, fueling my love for showing off my face card.)</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">This brings us to a few weeks ago, when I desperately needed groceries to kick off the beginning of what will surely be a great semester. As I perused through Trader Joe’s, I collected many sweet artifacts and treasures. I bartered with the weak punk-ass wimpy college employee that kindly bagged my gems and made great conversation with me (they definitely truly cared about me—it’s their job) and walked out of god’s gift to Earth with my giant bag of grocery on my shoulder. And then I strolled.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">As I strolled, however, I found the weight of the grocery to be difficult. It weighed me down. I could feel the demons beneath the crust and mantle using their divine influence to pull me into the core. So, I had to fight back the only way I knew how. By serving face. And serve face I did. My sharp jawline cut the <em id=\"\">Control</em> they had on me as my right brow arched so far, creating a <em id=\"\">The Velvet Rope (Deluxe Edition)</em> between my face card and the geoscience demons. However, as I looked down at my bag, I realized that the demons were also pulling down on my grocery, and as an Empath, I could feel it as well. I was losing this battle. And there was only one thing that could help.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n<p id=\"\">I looked down at my phone and pressed play to continue my first listen-through of <em id=\"\">janet. (Deluxe Edition)</em>. “DJ, make me wet.” Immediately, Janet started to moan and sensually whimper in my ear as <strong id=\"\">Throb</strong>, perhaps one of her best songs ever, blasted in my ears. “I can feel your body, pressed against my body, wrap yourself around me, love to feel you throbbin.’” I was empowered. The moaning and throbs trickled down my ears, throbbing through my entire temple (because, after all, that’s what our bodies are), striking great terror into the demons’ minds. They didn’t even stand a chance. “Boom, boom, boom, until noon, noon, noon.” All they got was three big booms and three small noons, and suddenly, I was immediately transported back to my lovely gutted Buswell South Campus apartment with my grocery. Smiling, I sighed and looked up like the manic pixie dream girl I am. I then began to unload my groceries and cook my dinner. And as I had just gotten groceries from Trader Joe’s, I was thankfully eating good that night. I sat down and put my meal all neatly arranged in front of me and dug in. And sure enough, the seven fingers and three breasts of Olga Syphil’s bastardized clone from the year 4673 was seasoned to perfection.</p>\n<p id=\"\">‍</p>\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>January 6, 2025</strong>—A mere fortnight before DJ Trump’s tragic second inauguration, gays took the Capitol by storm, armed only with $7 iced lattes, what was left of their poppers stash, and a dream. Now why would they do that, you ask? Storming the Capitol is tired and overdone—we saw how it went the first time. But if hordes of gun-toting, flag-waving Republicans can cause such a ruckus, then surely the gays could do them one better. Switch out those <strong>Trump Pride flags</strong> for <strong>Twink Pride flags</strong> and ditch the guns for meticulously rehearsed runway walks (right into the chamber). <strong>This time there was a battle worth fighting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the time of DJ Trump’s election, he made—as many politicians do—an abundance of false promises. Normally, I wouldn’t be too concerned about such empty words, the wishful “thinking” of what some “people” like to call our “president.” But this time something felt different. He spoke <strong>clearly (huh?)</strong> and with <strong>eloquence (say what?)</strong>, and I started to think... <strong>could he really be serious this time?</strong> Could he really be trying to pry poppers from the hands of the plethora of <strong>Troye Sivan look-alikes</strong> who were soon to grace the Capitol’s steps? I was getting a little bit scared this time. Not for myself, mind you, but for any of my dear friends who desperately want, who desperately <strong>NEED</strong> to feel the rush.</p>\n\n<p>I sometimes wonder about what good poppers could do for the Trump administration. If someone were to give <strong>RFK Jr.</strong> a little sniff, would his <strong>brain worm issue</strong> be sorted out? If <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> had cracked open the bottle in 2016, would he have been able to keep his eyes open on the Senate floor? If <strong>JD Vance</strong> had... well, actually, we all know that’s nothing new for him.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, <strong>this is not only an attack on the LGBTQ+ community but detrimental to the foundation of our nation’s political, diplomatic, and constitutional integrity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Just give the gays what they want!!</strong> If they won’t be able to <strong>pop</strong> the question soon, then we should at least let them keep their poppers.</p>\n",

The next, I was butt naked, the only thing on me were my eclipse glasses over my eyes. </p><p id=\"\">I looked around. No one else was naked, but at the same time, no one seemed to care that there was a possibility I could end up on a sex offenders list.</p><p id=\"\">The issue with gorgeous days on this godforsaken campus is that the tours will always find a way to ruin them. And even though I hated the way they walked too slowly and how they always took up the entire sidewalk, I knew in my heart that I had to warn the prospective students about how enrolling here put their outfits at risk of vanishing.</p><p id=\"\">But why didn’t they say anything? Why were the parents not concerned about the random nudity on campus? Why didn’t those high schoolers look at my nice gorgeous boobs and think to themselves, “Well gee, I can’t compete with those bad boys. I hope I can avoid the embarrassment of losing my clothes when I don’t even go here.”</p><p id=\"\">Feeling absolutely crazy, I used my phone to look at myself, because again, why did no one care about my indecent exposure? </p><p id=\"\">My eyes! They’re red! How could this be? Despite my fear, I hoped it would develop into laser vision. Then I could eradicate all the “interviewers” who walk around asking people what they would rate themselves on a scale of 1-10 by cutting them in half. I could be an X-Man.</p><p id=\"\">Fortunately for my enemies but unfortunately for me, I physically could not move, so I accepted defeat on the park bench. Smoke filled the air around me, and I hoped it would somehow cover me up. I then remembered the tiny little joint my friend had passed to me before my clothes went missing…</p><p id=\"\">I had thought that taking a little more of it would bring my clothes back. If anything went wrong, I had my inhaler in my bag! I mean, it’s not like someone ever died of cancer while using it. Maybe this will send me right over the edge. Maybe... I’ll get superpowers anyway…</p><p id=\"\">[UPDATE: I was greening out. My clothes were still on, I went nonverbal on the BU Beach and accidentally stared right into the eclipse. Most importantly, I passed that j around the circle for an obscene amount of time.]</p><p>‍</p>",

The heating is on but my boobs are cold and they are making an appearance tonight. They know what time it is. </p><p id=\"\">I have to move my clothes from washer to dryer while I’m blasting my saved tik tok audios in my ears or 212 by Azealia Banks- this is not an easy feat. When suddenly through this transaction, my underwear fresh from the wash slaps onto the floor of the room, echoing for all of Mayor Wu’s city to hear. It made a bigger impact than the earthquake. But no- it gets worse. a tall lanky man across the room sees this incident. I don’t dare to look, but I know the tension in the room has shifted. He wants me soooo bad. (he doesn’t even know there’s another person in the room). Seeing me in my big t-shirt and slippers with the dogs out definitely has him going. I’m literally Y/N. And look, times are rough right now. Hinge has not been hitting and in the words of Sue Sylvester, “i’m tired of being surrounded by uglies.” </p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">And essentially, this is the only time my clothes are on someone’s floor. So I’ve decided to add some spice into my life: I will continue to shamelessly let my panties fall out of the wash onto the floor for anyone to see. I’ll do a little sexy bend to pick them up and slowly toss them into the dryer with a little wrist action. I highly recommend this foolproof plan to all laundry room users. Anyone who sees this happen will have a laundry list of things they want to do to you against that vibrating washing machine. This is what Mitski always wanted.

I gave myself a quirky wink: it was going to be a good day.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">I decided to skip class, determined not to let even a silly lecture spoil my mood. I got a chai latte at Pavement, tipped generously, and boarded the green line to Boylston Trader Joes, where I planned to get a handful of almonds as a snack for my petite self and a bouquet of flowers to stick in my tote bag to seem really cool as I walk around Newbury.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">As we approached Kenmore station, a man that I could recognize anywhere boarded the T. In a red sox cap, with shoulder length dark hair, a beard, and a perpetually judgemental gaze, sat Noah Kahan.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Ever since I heard Stick Season on Tiktok last summer, his music has meant the world to me.

You excited?” I continued.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">With the mention of his highly anticipated series of summer concerts at Fenway, he finally chimed in, muttering “uhhh yeah, it's gonna be a good season.

Humble KING.</p><p id=\"\">“Wow, I can't believe how far you’ve come in the last few years,” I smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. “I know it doesn't mean much coming from a stranger, but I'm proud of you.”</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">“Thanks,” he replied after a pause. “No one ever says that to me. I’ve been going through a lot lately…”</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">As we locked eyes during that touching moment, a voice from the loudspeaker proclaimed “Now arriving at Copley Station.” I gave Noah a reassuring nod as I stood up and disembarked, forever touched by such a real and human moment with my idol.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

She’s got a silly little sparkle in her eye. She’s going to tell you a really good riddle, I’m sure of it. She’s got big over-the-ear headphones to best cancel the noise of everyone and everything around her. They are green, gray, and battered from the countless times they have fallen off the bed when she sleeps with them in. She’s tall, thin, and pale enough to count bruises on her knees and elbows and between the ridges of her spine.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">She has also had quite enough nonsense recently. Everywhere she goes, she is mistaken for a young gay male, otherwise commonly known as a “twink.” In public, she is often referred to as “young man” or “sir,” especially by little old ladies who need help crossing the street. Men hit on her in gay-friendly spaces, only to be disappointed by the fact that she is not who they are looking for.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">She is tirelessly searching for some sort of three step plan to let everyone know that she is NOT the little boy they think she is. Where are those Snapchat ads when you need them? Here is what she has planned so far:</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">One. Developing a signature posture. If she wants to pass for a straight girl, the hips cannot lie. She is practicing sashaying into buildings and reallllyyyy arching that back to make her figure stand out.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">Two. Training her voice to have vocal fry. This one has been very difficult, especially when placing orders for food at the dining halls. It takes at least three tries before any of her words become comprehensible. She thinks someone threw a French fry at her in line the other day.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">Three. Evolving into a new wardrobe. She has attempted to wear more cropped t-shirts and smaller pants recently, to try and blend in with the girls around her. She feels generally naked with the lack of excessive layers or earthy tones, but she’s sure that she won’t be mistaken for a young boy anymore.</p><p>‍</p><p id=\"\">Girltwink no more…hopefully. Armed with her new look, she is positive that she will never again be mistaken for a gay male!</p><p>‍</p>",
