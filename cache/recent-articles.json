Frankly, I’m very disappointed in the staff at Mass General Hospital, who I still owe 2,250 dollars. Yes, that’s right. Despite having iron clad insurance (Student plan <em>basic</em>), I somehow owe the hospital for my troubles. But to tell you, dear reader, how I decided to embrace Irish culture and drink till I woke up in Baskin Robbins, we must return to the night before…</p>\n\n  <p>The night before the big day, one of my best lads and I made the arduous journey to Star Market to buy a jug of water for some whimsical brewing. Now I know what you’re thinking: “Ugh, another person at the St. Patty’s day parade with a borg, how original.” First of all, what are you? The fucking Orange Order? Second, please do not belittle my amazing freedom juice to a borg. No, I created a potion, a mixture of rare liquids to replenish and fuel the body: 2 bottles of orange Powerade, redbull, and enough vodka to kill an English baby. As for the decorations, My glorious chalice of orange elixir was to be adorned with many classic Irish symbols: A leprechaun, a casket with Queen Elizabeth and Margaret Thatcher painted on it, and the title of the borg itself: <strong>“The Cran-Borg-ies.”</strong> Yes, I was about to let this borg linger all over Boston’s South End with the might of 1000 IRA patriots. I put my clothes out for tomorrow, a Celtic (the Football (soccer) team) jersey, jeans, and converse. I said one “Our Father,” reminded myself of my he/him pronouns, and fell asleep watching <em>Derry Girls</em>.</p>\n\n  <p>I woke up the next morning feeling properly Catholic, so I put on as many green things as I owned and a rosary for luck. Little did I know I was gonna need so much more than the luck of a four leaf clover. A few pre games, rattling bogs, and splitting the G’s later, I found myself in the South End. And you know what? I had been sooooo good the rest of the semester. Hey, I had cut down on my drinking down to about one rager per week, I stopped smoking 30%+ THC weed, and I hadn’t had a cig in like 4 days. I know I know, health influencer in the making, I’m just waiting for those brand deals to start rolling in. But I deserved to have a cheat day. And what better day to let your ginger locks down and sing “Come out ye black and tans” than St. Pattys. Everything was good, just chugging along at my borg until…</p>\n\n  <h2>DISASTER!!</h2>\n  <p>I woke up in a hospital bed. NOOOOOOOO! CURSE THE CROWN!!!!! How could this happen… How did this happen…Why am I so groggy?</p>\n\n  <p>I looked around at whoever was near me and saw one of my friends telling me that I was too drunk. I DEMANDED to leave. “Let me leave, let me leave” I said in a (no joke) Irish accent. Yeah I know you’re trying it for yourself right now, it’s not good but mine was worse. I was in utter disbelief of my situation. The doctor patted my arm as she told me “You thought you were in a Baskin Robbins 10 minutes ago.” Now there's an idea Doc, get one of the nurses to run out for a double scoop of mint chip on the double. I then went to do the next most important thing: access my phone. I could’ve called a trusted adult or friend, but what did I do? I went on reels for a sec just to get a little bump. My day had been absolutely shot, so I needed a little dopamine hit. After watching Irish unification propaganda for about 5 minutes, the doctor came back. But in my mind, it was an Englishman coming to take away my freedom. “I can't talk! I'm in my pub!” I yelled as I drew the covers way over my head. I did that repeatedly for about 20 more minutes, before I fell asleep again in the fetal position.</p>\n\n  <p>This just couldn’t be real. “Stupid, stupid, stupid!” I said to myself in bed. But there was no time to wallow in my pain. My mind immediately started racing as to what I needed to do to get the FUCK out of there. Like beloved Irishman Cillian Murphy did in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, I devised an explosive plan to burst out and never have to pay a hospital bill. I left my beloved blanket pub and sprung up. Think, think… Phone wallet keys! Wallet? Still in my orange puke-stained pocket. Keys? Yup, still on my carabiner (maybe this gave them the wrong idea…) And phone? In my hand, not playing reels, 0% battery. Problem. I became Matt Damon in <em>The Martian</em>: determined to survive and get the fuck back home by any means necessary.</p>\n\n  <p>If you’re still reading, congratulations, and as a reward you’re in for the best part of the story. I have to stress that the following is actually true. I looked at my surroundings to find a solution to my “dead phone” problem. My bed was positioned next to the nurses’ desk, where conveniently there was a phone charging on the desk. Ba-Fucking-zinga, salvation. I unplugged that poor nurse’s phone and plugged mine in. What a fucking saint, this guy right? Unplugging first responders’ phones just to watch reels has to be unethical. To that, I say if they can call my medical bill ethical, then I can use their fucking phone charger. I’m a philosophy major btw so just trust me on this one.</p>\n\n  <p>After playing <em>Brawl Stars</em> and texting back all my anxious friends, I yelled for the nurse, asking to be discharged. She did a couple more tests on me, and then I walked out. FREEDOM!!! My Bloody Sunday had become a Good Friday and I was again a free man. Hospital notes in hand, dried up vomit on my shirt. As I T’d my way back to my dorm, I looked at my hospital notes to see if there was anything important in there. Blah blah blah social security number bleh bleh insurance number. After I got all the boilerplate stuff out of the way, I got to my hospital notes and noticed something so shocking I audibly gasped.</p>\n\n  <p>\nAge: 20\nHeight: 5’8\nWeight: 155 lbs\nPronouns: They/Them\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>WHAT THE FUCK???????</h2>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No, I don't wear green. We exist.</h2>\n\n  <p>So, retrospectively, maybe the St. Patrick’s Day parade wasn’t the ideal function for me. But I put forth my best effort anyway in the name of The Cranberries. I found a shirt that’s lowkey blue and practiced my gaslighting in the mirror just in case anyone asked me about it on the road. I’d convince innocent strangers that they’re color blind if that’s what it took to attend this parade. <em>“THAT was for Ireland,”</em> I’d say under my breath as I walked away.</p>\n\n  <p>After a T ride so hellish I just about opened up a transfer application at Hynes Convention Center, my friends and I made it to Park Street and headed towards the Red line. Once my friends and I made it to the right station, I looked up at the sea of people waiting for the train and audibly gulped.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>I’d made a grave mistake.</strong></p>\n\n  <p>I am actually the only person in history who doesn’t own a St. Patty’s Day T-shirt in Boston, Massachusetts. Potentially in the Northeast. I couldn’t believe it. Did I miss a meeting? An email? Was it in the GroupMe? When did we all collectively decide that we were taking St. Patty’s Day seriously? I thought it was just the Irish and McDonald’s who were doing all that. It’s not a MAJOR holiday.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Fit mogged</strong> by an entire train. I felt sick. This is probably how they felt during the potato famine, only much worse and infinitely more serious.</p>\n\n  <p>At the parade, the situation only grew more dire. As the marching bands passed, I devolved into a state of bargaining. Hey, why didn’t anyone let me know the theme was green lowkey? Shady as hell. Here I was thinking that we were friends, and then everyone shows up to the function having VERY CLEARLY discussed dress code beforehand. Oh, so this was happening in the group chat I’m not in? Classic. And on the day of the Irish, too. It’s downright cruel, if you ask me.</p>\n\n  <p>To make myself feel calmer and better instantaneously, I opened Instagram.</p>\n\n  <p>There it was. My last straw.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Why is Mayor Wu wearing lobster Nikes on my timeline?</strong></p>\n\n  <p>Oh, she devoured me. Her fit went so hard, it felt personal. Emerald green dress and white to orange ombre sneakers to imitate the Irish flag in a subtle, yet self-aware fashion.</p>\n\n  <p>I couldn’t even be mad. The worst part was that it was all my own fault. My karmic balance doesn't hold a candle to Mayor Wu’s. My chances were slim to begin with, and I dropped the ball. It was over before it even began – <strong>I was fit mogged.</strong></p>\n\n  <p>After the events of this March, I will never be showing my face at a St. Patrick’s Day function again. I hope that’s okay with everyone. No worries if not.</p>\n\n  <p>To anyone reading this, please, I implore you – Depop one item of green clothing right now. After all, you never know whether or not your mayor’s Pinterest board is absolute flames.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You love your mom. She’s telling you how much she misses you, how she can’t wait to have you home for the summer. Your younger siblings will be pissed, but who cares? They deal with Mom and Dad all year. You? You’re about to return as the prodigal child, welcomed back with home-cooked meals and parents ready to grovel at your every request. Ah, the perks of being the sibling in college.</p>\n\n  <p>But then the conversation shifts. Your mom starts talking about… plans. Plans that don’t involve rotting in bed all summer. <em>Gulp.</em> She mentions her friend Andy. Andy has a firm. Andy needs help. Unpaid help. And then. She says it. <strong>“You know, you really need to find a SUMMER INTERNSHIP.”</strong></p>\n\n  <p>The phone drops from your hand. Mouth agape. Body trembling. How could your mom drop that <strong>SLUR</strong> so casually??? Has she learned nothing? You thought people could change. But no. Your own mother just dropped the most offensive phrase known to college students. Wow. How dare she?</p>\n\n  <p>You think your day couldn’t possibly get worse. You head to a film class lecture because let's be real, how many people reading this article aren’t FTV majors? Then. It happens again.</p>\n\n  <p>Your professor stands at the front of class, saying he has something important to bring up about… opportunities for students. You ease back a little into your chair. It’s probably about extra credit before the semester ends. But then, you see it. The dreaded “S” sound forming on his lips. The devious glint in his eye. He’s about to say it. <strong>“SUMMER INTERNSHIPS are hard to find, but I know many small film directors who need help on set.”</strong></p>\n\n  <p>You stand up in your chair, appalled. Aghast. Is this allowed??? Bring back WOKE and DEI because this professor has clearly gone insane! Spewing slurs left and right in front of a college class and calling it networking!!!???</p>\n\n  <p>It’s honestly ridiculous. You sprint out of the lecture hall, panting, heart racing. You fumble for your phone like it’s a life raft. You need TikTok. You need it now. But then you see it. An email. From your official BU advisor. Subject line: <strong>SUMMER INTERNSHIP ideas</strong>.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>GAHHHHH.</strong> A sharp pain radiates through your chest. Your vision blurs. This is it, the final straw. The slur… it’s going to kill you.</p>\n\n  <p>You collapse onto COM lawn. Bystanders look on in horror. A freshman, young and untainted by these woes, whispers, <em>“Oh my god, another one. That’s the third this week.”</em> The campus EMTs arrive. The waft resumes under your nose to try and shake you out of it. They remind you of how many juicy LinkedIn connections are waiting for you.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>“Experience is experience!”</strong> they shout as you flatline. But it’s too late. You’ve heard the word one too many times. Your soul lifts peacefully from your body as you drift into the unknown.</p>\n\n  <p><em>Your tombstone reads: “Here lies a BU student. Taken too soon by career readiness.”</em></p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

We all know BU isn’t exactly well known for its party scene. Allston gives us all she can, but at the end of the day, the frats just don’t do it for me! Am I still there every weekend? <strong>Unfortunately, yes.</strong> Pratt Street HATES to see my they/them/thon/thinary<sup>**</sup> ass coming.</p>\n\n    <p>If I’m going to do one thing on a Saturday night, it’s fight my way into a basement with the humidity of the Amazon Rainforest to drink lukewarm cans of Bus(c)h Lite. What ever happened to kegs? <em>LMK.</em> All to listen to the world’s worst DJ spin 2010’s top 100. Coach <strong>PLEASE</strong> put me in so I could do so much better.</p>\n\n    <p>Compared to most schools, BU’s frat guys are actually sometimes kind of woke? But only in the sense that they’re REALLY scared of getting cancelled. Anyways. That’s beside the point.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <h2>Introducing the Myth:</h2>\n    <p>Welcome to another episode of <strong>Lesbian Mythbuster</strong>, where we bust on her myth till we discover the secrets of the universe.</p>\n\n    <p>It is only in my deepest hopes and dreams that I find myself far far away from Allston (hell) at a Wellesley Lesbian Party. But they’re elusive! I don’t even know where Wellesley is!</p>\n\n    <p>So I was left to ask a few questions:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Is Wellesley even real?</li>\n      <li>Where is it?</li>\n      <li>How do I get there?</li>\n      <li>Why are there so many Lesbians?</li>\n      <li>What time is The Lesbian Party?</li>\n      <li>What kind of music do they play?</li>\n      <li>What’s the address?</li>\n      <li><strong>And...how do I get there?</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>As a person of great scientific inquiry skills, honed through years of experimentation, I did what I do best. I puzzled, questioned, made connections, and investigated.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <h2>Formulating a Hypothesis:</h2>\n    <p>I hypothesize that Wellesley is somewhere...<strong>West?</strong> This is a vibes based assumption! Also I fear we can’t really go East (Hiii Atlantic Ocean) so I’m ruling that one out.</p>\n\n    <p>Based on the supposedly MAJOR Lesbian population I’m going to take a shot in the dark and say that Wellesley is a historically women’s college. Just a guess! If it’s not then sue me or something. <em>IDGAF!</em></p>\n\n    <p>I fear there might be a secret code of some sorts to get into this Lesbian Party. Perhaps one’s carabiner must jangle at a certain decibel? Or maybe you need a little mullet? A standing account at your local U-HAUL? A treasure map to the Island of Lesbos? (I bet you can’t guess what spot the X marks). Who’s to say! We’ll just have to wait and find out.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <h2>Experiment Design:</h2>\n    <p><strong>So here’s the plan:</strong></p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hop on the commuter rail. Head West.</li>\n      <li>Begin Wandering. I’ll know when I’m where I’m meant to be.</li>\n      <li>Keep my eyes peeled for thumb rings, Clairo haircuts, chunky shoes, outer arm tattoos, and septum piercings. You know, the essentials.</li>\n      <li>See where the wind takes me. Not your usual scientific proceedings, but! What more can I do?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <h2>Conducting the Experiment:</h2>\n    <p>The day finally came. I woke and donned my favorite baggy jeans (ft. repaired belt loop following a casualty from carabiner overuse), clipped on my carabiner, and hopped on the train.</p>\n\n    <p>I can’t even lie, I was a little nervy! Who knew what was awaiting me on the other side. But when I stepped off the train it was like the air stood still. <strong>I was home.</strong></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <h2>Analyzing the Results:</h2>\n    <p>Unfortunately, dear readers, I have sworn by blood oath to protect the secrets of the Wellesley Lesbian Party with my life. And as a scientist I simply <strong>MUST</strong> uphold the standard ethical proceedings that come with discovery.</p>\n\n    <p>But what I can say is this: If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, and try again. If it’s meant to be, the Wellesley Lesbian Party <strong>WILL</strong> find you.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <footer>\n    <p><sup>**</sup>as coined by THE Sage Clark</p>\n  </footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Whether they’re always at a protest, or somehow constantly on the verge of legal trouble, being on the political frontlines is not for the faint of heart. You, dear reader, might even be that wonderful snowflake! Nevertheless, the leftist brigade must stay vigilant, and that includes keeping our bodies healthy and strong to fight the good fight.</p>\n\n  <p>Here are some general guidelines to structure your very own woke fitness plan in these dark, dark times:</p>\n\n  <strong>CARDIO IS KEY.</strong>\n  <p>I’m sorry! Everyone hates cardio, and for good reason–it sucks. You know what sucks more? Wheezing through a KN95 after you yelled just a teensy bit too loud. Watching a 60-year-old cop outrun you after he sat in his car for 8 hours watching YouTube on his laptop. Keep your heart and lungs healthy, your legs strong, and ensure you can actually sprint away if someone yells, “Scatter!”</p>\n\n  <strong>FOCUS ON STRENGTH, NOT GLAMOUR.</strong>\n  <p>Let me be clear: the goal is not to achieve an 8-pack, cum gutters, or beautifully defined back muscles like that one masc lesbian you keep seeing on Instagram Reels. What good will that do you when you’re in full blackout, anyway? Focus on building strength holistically, and try to incorporate the whole body - be as steady as a mountain, as adaptable as the murmuring brook. When the day of reckoning comes, will you be able to hold the line?</p>\n\n  <strong>BE CONSISTENT.</strong>\n  <p>In the same way you show up for your allies, show up for yourself. Rough day arguing with that one lowkey White supremacist in your class? Hit the gym! Half an hour after a rally and you still have pent-up energy you don’t know what to do with? Go for a run! Eventually, fitness will feel like second nature, and one day, you will finally be able to punch an officer of the law and get away with it.</p>\n\n  <p><em>Best of luck with your pursuits, and be on the lookout for a more detailed workout routine soon!</em></p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

      "content": "<body>\n  <p>WASHINGTON, DC - During a rally this past Tuesday, Musk announced his new Donald and Elon Intercourse program (DEI). This program, claimed to be the first of its kind, will allegedly restore balance to the universe by “promoting manly stuff and memes”.</p>\n\n  <p>While announcing his new DEI plan, Musk said that he was inspired by his studies of Roman literature. Musk in the past has made his inspiration known with his use of the roman salute. Referencing a famous text written by Romulus Augustulus, Elon announced that <strong>“if a guy has a bbl it’s not gay to hit it”</strong>, which he followed by jumping weirdly up and down and snorting ketamine on stage.</p>\n\n  <p>It’s unclear what exactly this initiative entails, as Musk began to quickly derail and talk about his bought league of legends account. However, we were given some details within the 3 hour speech.</p>\n\n  <p>Musk was quoted saying that the program will contain “buttstuff for all manly men” and that “this is how we return America to its genetically pure ways”. He also referred to the bible, a trend common amongst Trump officials, referencing Jermiah 11:11. “SpaceX more like Gay Sex!” Musk shouted, apparently reading from the old testament.</p>\n\n  <p>Other parts of this initiative include free beta-blockers which Musk asserts will get rid of all Beta’s in American society in favor of Omegas.</p>\n\n  <p>He also announced the Butt Plug GDP initiative, a program meant to increase the supply and demand of Butt Plug in order to increase GDP. “This will increase shareholder value by 1000%” claimed Musk, as he snorted another line of Ketamine. Economists are still unsure how exactly this initiative will work, given the current tariffs on sex toys.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",
